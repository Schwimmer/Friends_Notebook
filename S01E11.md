**Ross:** So, what's going on now?

**Joey:** I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)

**Joey:** Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down颠倒的. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us朝我们走来! Run! Run!

(Joey runs off down the hall. Ross tries(v.试着打开) Monica and Rachel's apartment, but it is locked so he has to stand in the hall and pretend he wasn't listening. Chandler and his mom come out)

**Mrs. Bing:** You okay, kiddo老姐,老兄(一种亲昵的称呼)?

**Chandler:** Yeah, okay.

**Mrs. Bing:** Alright. (Kisses him)

**Chandler:** Nice save圆场时说的话.

> nice save:赛场上救了个好球救叫nice save，NICE SAVE用来圆场的时候都可以用的，还有例如某人说话，说到半道发现再说就要出错或出丑了，于是及时改了下半句，听出端倪的人就会说：“nice save！”我想chan大概是赞他妈这个吻不错。NICE SAVE用来圆场的时候都可以用的。

(She walks down the hall)

**Ross:** (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.

**Mrs. Bing:** Mr. Geller.

(She leaves)

(Ross knocks on Monica and Rachel's door)

**Chandler:** Hey.

**Ross:** You mean that你当真?

**Chandler:** Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.

**Ross:** Yeah? How'd it go?

**Chandler:** Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.

**Ross:** Well, howdya feel?

**Chandler:** Pretty good! I told her.

**Ross:** Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to go down that road.

> wag vt.摇摆,摇动/go down that road走这条路了.指代:假装排练戏剧
