**109 **气球飞了 乔伊为卫生机构的海报当模特，后来方知那是治疗性病的广告。 罗斯发现苏珊在为卡萝肚里的孩子念书听，不甘示弱决定照做。 因父母外出，罗斯和莫妮卡开始准备自己的感恩节大餐； 菲比要和他俩一起庆祝，因为她向来同祖母一起过感恩节，而祖母的新男友用阴历不用阳历，他们家将在12月才过感恩节。 乔伊也加入了，因为他家里人以为他有脏病。 钱德力图抵制感恩节因为当年他的父母在节日那天宣布离婚； 瑞秋的如意算盘则是和家人去山里滑雪。 游行当中大气球脱线飞走了；大家都跑上楼顶去看热闹，结果忘带钥匙全被关在了莫妮卡的门外； 晚饭烧焦了，瑞秋误掉了班机，大家只好吃钱德的奶酪三明治和洋葱小食品作为晚餐。 丑陋裸男邀来丑陋裸女共进感恩节晚餐，之后他们携手丑陋裸舞*

[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is confronting面对 her boss, Terry.]

**Rachel:** Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary预支100美元的薪水?

**Terry:** An advance?

**Rachel:** It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally通常地 my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence独立自主 thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.

> 我们都比较熟悉so…that句型，也比较熟悉to do sth so that+从句的形式，这里so that使用方式在口语中也比较常见，也是表达因果关系的联词。/Vail:剧中瑞秋攒钱想和家人一起去韦尔(Vail)度感恩节假。韦尔是美国最著名的两个滑雪圣地之一，在丹佛市附近。它的特色是滑雪山坡离市区很近，从家中穿上滑雪鞋就可去滑雪。此外，它夏天还有音乐会，因此成为美国富人云集的度假胜地。

**Terry:** Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.

**Rachel:** Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you我同意你. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that.

**Opening Credits**

[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is approaching a customer.]

**Rachel:** Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips预支小费?

**Guy:** Huh?

**Rachel:** Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill溅出 before. (picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go.

(Monica enters.)

**Monica:** Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico 波多黎各for Thanksgiving?

> 本集故事就发生在Thanksgiving（感恩节）的大背景下，这个节日始于1621年。那年秋天，远涉重洋来到美洲的英国移民，为了感谢上帝赐予的丰收，举行了3天的狂欢活动。从此，这一习俗就沿续下来，并逐渐风行各地。1863年，美国总统林肯正式宣布感恩节为国定假日。届时，家家团聚，举国同庆，其盛大、热烈的情形，不亚于中国人过春节，在美国甚至比圣诞节还要隆重，这个节日里面，饭桌上火鸡（Turkey）和南瓜饼(Pumpkin Pie)是必不可少的菜肴，因此又叫火鸡节，这些希望能够在观看的时候慢慢体会。/关于英美的主要节日，这里也做一个介绍： 
> New Years Day：新年，元旦，1月1日；St.Valentine's Day：圣瓦伦丁节（情人节）2月14日；All Fools's Day or April Fools's Day：愚人节4月1日；Good Friday：耶稣受难日（复活节前的星期五）；Easter：复活节（春分月圆后第一个星期日，4月）；Easter Monday复活节后的星期一；Holy Thursday：耶稣升天节（复活节后的40天的星期四）；May Day or Labour Day：五一劳动节；the Spring Bank Holiday：春假（英国5月最后一个星期一）；Mother's Day：母亲节（5月第二个星期日）；Memorial Day：阵亡将士纪念日（美国，5月26日）；Independence Day：美国独立纪念日（7月4日）；the Summer Bank Holiday：夏季公假（英国，8月最后一个星期一）；Columbus Day：哥伦布日（10月12日）；Halloween：万圣节前夕（10月31日）；Hallowmas：万圣节（11月1日）；Armistice day or Veterans Day：第一，二次世界大战的停战纪念日（11月11日）；Thanksgiving Day：感恩节（在美国是11月的第二个星期一）；Christmas Eve：圣诞节前夜（12月24日）；Christmas Day：圣诞节（12月25日）；Boxing Day：节礼日（圣诞节次日，如遇星期日，推迟一天）。

**Ross:** You're wrong.

**Monica:** I am not wrong.

**Ross:** You're wrong.

**Monica:** No, I just talked to them.

**Ross:** (getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom.

(Joey enters. His face looks abnormally反常地 colorful.)

**Joey:** Hey, hey.

**Chandler:** Hey.

**Phoebe:** Hey.

**Chandler:** And this from the cry-for-help呼救 department. Are you wearing makeup涂了化妆品?

**Phoebe:** What were you modeling for?

**Joey:** You know those posters海报 for the city free clinic诊所?

**Monica:** Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?

**Phoebe:** You know, the asthma哮喘 guy was really cute.

**Chandler:** Do you know which one you're gonna be?

**Joey:** No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)

> lyme arthritis 莱姆关节炎(伴有疼痛、发热与皮肤红斑)

**Chandler:** Good luck, man. I hope you get it.

**Joey:** Thanks.

(Ross comes back to the couch.)

**Ross:** (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.

**Monica:** Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.

**Ross:** Will you make the mashed potatoes马铃薯泥 with the lumps块?

> mash v.捣碎

**Monica:** You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?

**Joey:** Yeah.

**Monica:** And I assume想, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.

> boycott vt.联合抵制/ Boycott本来是一个人名，后来演变成专有名词，意思是“拒绝出席、拒绝参加、抵制反抗、经济制裁”等。/pilgrim n.圣地朝拜者,清教徒

**Chandler:** Yes, every single one of them每一个.

**Monica:** Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?

**Phoebe:** Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar月亮的，阴历的.

**Monica:** So you're free Thursday, then.

**Phoebe:** Yeah. Oh, can I come?

**Monica:** Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?

**Rachel:** Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.

**Chandler:** I thought it was $98.50.

**Rachel:** Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.

**Ross:** Well, I'm off to Carol's.

**Phoebe:** Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?

**Ross:** (mimicking摹仿) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.

[Scene: Carol and Susan's apartment, Susan is there. Ross enters.]

**Ross:** Hi, is uh, is Carol here?

**Susan:** No, she's at a faculty meeting.

> faculty n.才能, 本领, 能力, 全体教员, (大学的)系, 科/faculty meeting n.教授会，教员会议

**Ross:** Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull头骨，颅骨. Well, not mine, but...**Susan:** Come in.

**Ross:** Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.

**Susan:** What's it look like?

**Ross:** Kinda like a big face without skin.

**Susan:** Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.

**Ross:** Ok. (browsing浏览 the apartment房间) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.

**Susan:** Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.

**Ross:** (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle海龟. A classic.

> Yertle the Turtle: 剧中罗斯看的一本书——经典童话作品《乌龟大王亚尔特》Yertle the Turtle是知名儿童小说家苏斯博士（Dr. Seuss）的名著。是讲海龟王Yertle让海龟们堆起来成它的王座，结果最后倒下来的故事。乌龟大王亚特尔為了掌握更大的權柄，统治更宽阔的领土，于是他命令属下的乌龟叠罗汉，将他给抬高，他以为只要他极目所及之处，尽是他的领土。所以，他不断的想要超越他人，也因此，叠罗汉越叠越高。最后，他更妄想超越月亮，想不到因低曾的一只乌龟打了一个喷嚏，整个乌龟王国就全盘瓦解了，而跌得最重的正是乌龟大王亚尔特，亚尔特正是苏斯博士对希特勒的讽刺。

**Susan:** Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

**Ross:** The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?

**Susan:** What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?

**Ross:** You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?

**Susan:** Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.

**Ross:** Do you uh, do you talk about me?

**Susan:** Yeah, yeah, all the time.

**Ross:** Really?

**Susan:** But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.

> Bobo the Sperm Guy：man who is used for sexual purposes only.(can also be used to identify an anonymous sperm donor)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there but Rachel.]

**Ross:** Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not(前置，表强调) that I believe any of this=I don’t believe any of this.

> belly n.腹部，胃/belly-time胎教时间/“Not that I believe any of this”，这是一个强调句型，相当于I don’t belive any of this，Ross一方面不想让Susan一个人独享同胎儿亲近的机会，另一方面又非着重强调他是个PHD的身份,不相信这一套。在托福考试听力部分也常有这种用法。比如M:I hear the hocky game was packed. W:Not an empty seat in the house!Just standing room only.第一个人说：“我听说曲棍球比赛爆满了。第二个人回答说：“场地里没有空位置了，只有站的地方。”，这里第二个人说话时也把Not 着重强调。

**Phoebe:** Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.

**Chandler:** I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much(前置，表强调) like to butter your head.

> be behind sb or sth=agree with,go alont with ,back up ,on the side of,support=be with sb=be for you/butter vt.涂黄油于...上

(Rachel enters.)

**Monica:** Hey, Rach, did you make your money?

**Rachel:** No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

**Monica:** Rach, here's your mail.

**Rachel:** Thanks, you can just put it on the table.

**Monica:** (insistently坚持地) No, here's your mail.

**Rachel:** Thanks, you can just put it on the table.

**Monica:** (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?

(Rachel opens it. Inside is the money she needed.)

**Rachel:** Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.

**Monica:** We all chipped in.

> chip in v.插嘴, 捐助, 下注/ chip in：I'm very sorry that I can only afford to chip in a few dollars this time.很抱歉这次我只能捐助区区几块钱了。Donate就显得正式多了，书面语中常见。The businessman donated a lot of money to the hospital. 这个商人捐给医院很多钱。论坛上也有号召捐款的帖子，个人以为不如改为凑份儿更合适。

**Joey:** (to Monica) We did?

**Monica:** (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.

**Rachel:** Thank you. Thank you so much!

**Monica:** (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.

> grill v. n.烤架, 铁格子, 烤肉v.烧, 烤, 严加盘问/fixing n.调料/grilled cheese fixing烤起司配料/family-size bag of Funyun特大号的洋葱小食品/Funyuns: 1969年百事可乐的菲多利推出的Funyuns牌洋葱味小食品。需要指出的是，百事并不只是生产饮料，在69年就提出了。“你们的生活丰富多彩，百事的产品同样丰富多彩”的广告主题。这点国内的朋友可以了解的要少一些。Chandler因为父母在感恩节那天宣布离婚，从此之后Chandler就对所有的宗教色彩节日反感，于是Monica给他装了西红柿汤、烤奶酪以及一些小食品给他。

**Rachel:** Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?

> 这其中故事大家都很熟悉了，只有Rachel不清楚，所以她不解地问：你和这节日怎么回事呀？（what is it with you and this holiday），这句话应该熟记，以后有什么觉得好奇的时候，就不用生硬的去问what’s wrong 或者what’s the matter了。

**Chandler:** All right, I'm nine years old.

**Ross:** Oh, I hate this story.

**Chandler:** We just finished this magnificent丰盛的 Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie满满一嘴的南瓜饼, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.

**Rachel:** Oh my god.

**Chandler:** Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse完全颠倒.

> Reverse:可以做形容词，表示颠倒的、反常的或者向后转的，如：a reverse gear. 倒车档，也可以做名词，表示相反、反面以及失败、逆运，比如：suffered financial reverses.遭受财政困难，还可以做动词，表示颠倒、翻转、撤销。无论是什么词性，都可以从“反面的”这一意思推倒而出，这里用了in reverse，表示的是与…相反之意。整句话如下翻译：只要你也体验一次完全颠倒过来了的感恩节，就很难再去喜欢感恩节盛宴了。

[Scene: The subway, Joey spots a gorgeous woman waiting. He goes up to her.]

> spot vt.认出, 发现

**Joey:** Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.

**Girl:** We did?

**Joey:** Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis?

> obsession n.迷住, 困扰/spray cologne 喷洒古龙香水

**Girl:** Yeah, right.

**Joey:** I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business行业.

**Girl:** Get out少来了.

**Joey:** I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.

> spritz n.v.喷/ lay back使向后,放回,送回

**Girl:** Really? You don't know what that means to me.

**Joey:** Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?

**Girl:** (provocatively煽动地，挑衅地) Nothing.

**Joey:** Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?

**Girl:** Yeah. (she gets up, notices something behind Joey) Oh.

**Joey:** What's wrong?

**Girl:** I just remembered, I have to do something.

**Joey:** Oh. What?

**Girl:** Um, leave.

**Joey:** Wait, wait, wait!

> cider n.苹果酒/mull vt.研磨, 深思vi.温热/yam n.山药，洋芋

**Ross:** I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.

**Monica:** All right, that's it我受够了. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.

**Ross:** That's closer.

(Rachel enters, excited.)

**Rachel:** I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.

**Chandler:** Oh, you must stop shooping.

> shoo int. 嘘/stop shooping不要再嘘了

**Rachel:** Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.

**Joey:** Chandler, will you just come in already?

**Chandler:** No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment欢喜.

(Phoebe takes a slice of pumpkin pie and waves it in front of Chandler's face.)

**Phoebe:** Look out小心，当心, incoming来了 pumpkin pie!

**Chandler:** Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing塞配料, but that's not funny anymore.

(Chandler leaves.)

**Joey:** Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots塔特酒.

**Monica:** That's not a question.

**Joey:** But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.

> cranberry sauce n.酸果曼沙司/tot n.小孩,一小杯(酒)

**Monica:** All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.

**Ross:** Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.

**Monica:** Ah!

**Ross:** Ok, Mom never hit.

(Ross exits.)

**Phoebe:** (stirring pot) Ok, all done.

> stir v.搅拌

**Monica:** What, Phoebe, did you whip(=mash搅烂) the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!

**Phoebe:** Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas豌豆 and onions洋葱.

**Monica:** Why would we do that?

**Phoebe:** Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.

**Monica:** Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.

**Rachel:** Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!

> ski n.滑雪板vi.滑雪板

(Chandler enters, running.)

**Chandler:** The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.

**Joey:** The balloon气球?

**Chandler:** No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news新闻上随处可见. Right before he reached *Macy's*, he broke free断线脱逃 and was spotted flying over WashingtonSquarePark. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?

> inflatable adj.通货膨胀的,膨胀的/let loose v.释放，放出，放任

**Phoebe:** Almost never.

**Monica:** Got the keys? *or* Got the keys!

**Rachel:** Ok.

(Everyone leaves the apartment.)

[Scene: Carol and Susan's, Ross is preparing to talk to her belly.]

**Carol:** Anytime you're ready只要你准备好了任何时候都可以

**Ross:** Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage只有一种方法能有效传递声音, but...

**Carol:** Just aim for the bump隆起处.

**Ross:** Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes开始吧. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.

**Carol:** So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.

**Ross:** (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the group is coming back from the roof.]

**Rachel:** I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow影子 all over the park.

**Phoebe:** Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down击落,击毙? I mean, that was just mean不舒服的to残忍的.

**Monica:** Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside外皮很脆, juicy on the inside内肉多汁. Why are we standing here?

**Rachel:** We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.

**Monica:** No I don't.

**Rachel:** Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."

**Monica:** No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"

**Rachel:** No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".

**Chandler:** Do either of you **have** the keys?

**Rachel:** Oh, I gotta get my ticket!

**Joey:** Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.

**Monica:** Well then get it, get it!

**Joey:** That tone will not make me go any faster.

**Monica:** (angry) Joey!

**Joey:** That one will.

(Joey leaves to get the copy of the key.)

[Scene: Carol and Susan's, Carol is reading, Ross is talking to her stomach(=belly).]

**Ross:** And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major选一门专业, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare鼓起勇气, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.

(Susan enters.)

**Susan:** Hi, how's it goin?

**Ross:** Shh! (singing) *Here we come, walkin' down the street, get** the funniest looks*暴笑* from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey*! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?

**Carol:** I did.

**Ross:** Does it always, uh--?

**Carol:** No, no that was the first.

**Susan:** Keep singing! Keep singing!

**Ross:** (singing) *Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a **bagel*百吉饼,甜面圈*, and then we'll go to the zoo*.

**Susan:** I felt it!

**Ross:** (singin) *Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts*.

[Scene: The Hallway, Joey has a tray盘子 full of keys, and is trying each one in the lock.]

**Joey:** Nope, not that one.

**Monica:** Can you go any faster with that?

**Joey:** Hey, I got one keyhole锁眼 and about a zillion keys. You do the math.

> zillion n.<美口> 庞大的数字, 无法计算的大数字

**Monica:** Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?

**Chandler:** (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.

**Rachel:** (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not.

**Monica:** I swear you said you had the keys.

**Rachel:** No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.

**Phoebe:** Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.

(Short pause.)

**Monica:** Why would I have the keys?

**Rachel:** Aside from除了 the fact that you said you had them?

> from the fact that从...的事实上来看

**Monica:** But I didn't.

**Rachel:** Well, you should have.

**Monica:** Why?

**Rachel:** Because!

**Monica:** Why?

**Rachel:** Because!

**Monica:** Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned烧焦了, and, and I... I...

**Chandler:** Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.

(They walk in. Smoke fills the apartment.)

**Monica:** Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined全毁了, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.

(Ross enters, singing.)

**Ross:** Here we come, walkin' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's.

**Monica:** No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan平低锅 of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.

**Rachel:** Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.

**Joey:** Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.

**Monica:** Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?

> bust v.<非正>打破,击破/bust my ass何苦,吃力不讨好地

**Joey:** You call that delicious?

(all shouting)

**Monica:** Stop it, stop it, stop it!

**Chandler:** Now this feels like Thanksgiving.

[Time lapse. Everyone is upset with each other. Phoebe is at the window.]

**Phoebe:** Ooh.

**Rachel:** What?

**Phoebe:** Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal(=girl)女孩.

(They all run to the window.)

**Joey:** I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!

**Monica:** Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!

**Phoebe:** It's nice that he has someone.

[Time lapse. The gang is around the table, eating grilled cheese sandwiches烤起司三明治.]

**Chandler:** Shall I carve?

> carve v.a.切(熟肉等)b.雕刻

**Rachel:** By all means请便.

**Chandler:** Ok, who wants light cheese浅色起司, and who wants dark cheese深色起司?

**Ross:** I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.

**Monica:** (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?

**Joey:** Oh, I will.

**Phoebe:** Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.

**Monica:** Make a wish?

**Phoebe:** Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?

**Joey:** The bigger half.

> 在感恩节的时候，两个人掰面包，掰之前想个愿望，如果谁掰到了大的一半，他的愿望就能实现，Joey掰到了大的一半，Phoebe问他许的是什么愿，结果傻Joey许的愿就是:掰到大的一半。

**Chandler:** I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
