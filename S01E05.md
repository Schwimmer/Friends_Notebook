[Scene: Central Perk, all six are there.]

**Monica:** Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.

**Ross:** Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned就我个人而言, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?

> maneuver n.<法>策略，巧计，花招/bam n.vt.欺骗, 哄骗, 迷惑/sleeve n.袖子
> 老友们关系实在太融洽了，在一起侃大山什么都敢掏心，这一次聊天不知怎么就撤到了互相揭男人女人的短上来了，Ross先开头，他觉得女人们能像变戏法一样地把bra 从衣服的袖子里拿出来真是太神奇了， maneuver 这个词源自法语，本意是“体力劳动”，在英语中作名词时是“策略、巧计、花招”的意思，在这里表示一种很巧妙的动作或手法。另外再看一下bam，这是一个象声词，一声枪响就可以用bam来形容，但它经常被用来表示 “突然、一下子”的意思。

**Rachel:** Come on! You guys can pee standing up.

> Rachel听了Ross的话后也不以为然，她说: “得了，你们男人还能站着撒尿呢 (Come on! You guys can pee standing up.)” pee是个非常口语化的词，用医学术语来表示的话就是urinate;通常我们只在熟人之间才会用pee这个词，而在一般情况下如果你内急了的话可以说 I need / have to go to the bathroom.

**Chandler:** We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.

**Joey:** Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.

> blow my mind对某事感到既惊奇又兴奋/be beyond sb某件事使某人难以理解/blow one’s mind 又是一个很好的口语，它表示 “对某件事情感到既惊奇又兴奋”.blow还有别的用法，比如You’d better cherish the opportunity and don’t blow it.这里的blow表示搞砸锅的意思。此外，beyond的用法值得注意，它基本的意思是 “超越”，在口语中如果你说sth is beyond my mind，就表示某件事情对你而很难理解，比如：The professor’s lecture is beyond my mind。

**Phoebe:** Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean下流的 things, and then not even care.

> 最后Phoebe 说： “Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.”她挖苦说道，男人们可以作很多卑鄙无耻的事情却可以大摇大摆好不介意。 mean在这里作形容词，意思是 “很不好、卑鄙的”，口语中很常见。

(Long pause.)

**Ross:** Multiple orgasms!

> orgasm n.性高潮/Multiple orgasms n.多次高潮

**Opening Credits**

[Scene: Central Perk, all are there.]

**Chandler:** So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!

**Joey:** No plans, huh?

**Chandler:** Not a one.

**Ross:** Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?

**Chandler:** Oh, right, right, shut up.

**Monica:** Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.

**Chandler:** No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do鼓起勇气去做 it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.

> get up the courage to do=nerve oneself to do sth，be on one’s mettle to do sth，take heart of grace to do sth…生活中常需要鼓起勇气作些事情，Chandler这里就不得不鼓足勇气去分手

**Joey:** Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.

**Phoebe:** You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.

**Chandler:** Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.

> gang up on sb v.联合反对

**Phoebe:** No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.

**Ross:** Tony?

**Monica:** Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?

**Phoebe:** Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.

> hunger strike n.(绝食)以表示抗议

**Rachel:** (waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?

**Ross:** Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.

> nutty adj.多坚果的/chocolatey adj.巧克力味的

**Phoebe:** (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?

> scrunch vt.a.碾，压，踩，咬嚼b.缩紧c.揉皱/scrunchy adj.皱眉的，愁眉苦脸的/ scrunch的意思是嘎吱嘎吱的响声；揉成一团，pheobe说话总是很形象，scrunchy这词感觉大概就是形容，心里不舒服，搅来搅去烦得想揍人

**Rachel:** It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.

> convertible adj.可改变的，自由兑换的/Mercedes convertible宾士敞篷车

**Ross:** That guy, he burns me up他使我生气.

> burn up v.烧起来，烧掉，发怒

**Rachel:** Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me *young lady*.

**Chandler:** Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.

**Monica:** Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this你不适合在这里" thing again?

**Rachel:** Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".

> extended version加长版/chorus n. n.合唱, 合唱队, 齐声/make it on your own自立

**Phoebe:** (rhythmically有节奏地) Uh-huh, uh-huh.

(Angela, a beautiful woman in a tight dress, enters.)

**Angela:** Hi, Joey.

**Joey:** My god, Angela.

(Angela takes a seat坐下 at the counter.)

**Monica:** Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.

> agree with v.同意，适合

**Phoebe:** Are you gonna go over there?

**Joey:** No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to her) Hey, Angela.

> One Mississippi，，two Mississippi,three Mississippi 乔伊在咖啡馆巧遇前女友安杰拉，安杰拉似乎对他不再有感觉。乔伊决定重新去认识她，但为了不显得焦急，就数了三下：One Mississippi，two Mississippi，three Mississippi，然后再走上前去。这其实是橄榄球运动员开球前的数数方法，有时要数到Five Mississippi，所以乔伊说这个办法很酷。

**Angela:** (casually) Joey.

**Joey:** You look good.

**Angela:** That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.

> accent n.重音, 口音, 重音符v.重读to强调

**Joey:** You don't say =Really? Is that really true?.

(Cut to Ross and Rachel, talking next to one of the tables.)

**Ross:** So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?

**Rachel:** Oh, big glamour night内容丰富的夜晚. Me and Monica at Laundorama.

> glamour n.[亦作glamor] 魔力, 魅力v.迷惑/Laundorama n.洗衣店的名称/laundry n.洗衣店，所洗的礼服

**Ross:** Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?

> freaky adj.(=freakish)畸形的, 捉摸不定的,奇怪的

**Rachel:** Who?

**Ross:** Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?

**Rachel:** Don't you have a laundry room in your building?

**Ross:** Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat老鼠 problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish七点?

> A be attracted to B A对B有兴趣/dryer n.干燥纸/fluffy adj.绒毛似的, 披着绒毛的, 蓬松的, 愚蠢的/dryer n.干燥剂

**Rachel:** Sure.

(Cut back to Joey and Angela at the counter.)

**Angela:** Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.

**Joey:** Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

**Angela:** Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated成熟的, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...

> audition n.试镜，试听

**Joey:** Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff并不只是寻幻作乐, but like, talking too.

**Angela:** Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?

**Joey:** What?

**Angela:** We're just friends.

**Joey:** Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?

**Angela:** What four of us?

**Joey:** You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment, Joey is there, trying to convince Monica to pose as his girlfriend. His plan is to hook Monica up with Angela's boyfriend Bob and then take Angela back for himself.]

> convince sb to do使某人确信，说服某人/pose vi.佯装/hook n.钩, 吊钩v.钩住, 沉迷, 上瘾/hook sb up勾引上某人/take sb up夺回某人

**Joey:** Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.

**Monica:** Forget it算了吧. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.

> belch v.打嗝, (火山、炮等)冒烟、喷出n.打嗝, 喷射
> belch the alphabet 所谓打嗝会嗝出字母，就是指有些无聊的人，会故意打一个长长的嗝，然后会利用打嗝发出字母的音，有一些很厉害又没事的无聊人，真的有办法用打嗝从A念到Z。其实这是一个很粗俗又没教养的行为，而美国人会觉得这样做的人是“红脖子”redneck，这个字代表“美国南方乡下作粗活的人”，是一种很鄙视性的说法

**Joey:** Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...

**Monica:** (looking out window) Oh, god help us.

**Joey:** What?

**Monica:** Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!

> tile n.瓷砖，瓦片/lay kitchen tile铺厨房瓷砖

**Joey:** Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor寻求帮助 here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.

**Monica:** What's going on here? You go out with tons of许多 girls.

**Joey:** (proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?

[Scene: Ross' apartment, Chandler is over.]

**Ross:** (on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.

**Chandler:** Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?

> hold on v.等下/camper n.露营者to 老兄

**Ross:** It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal不用想那么多.

> minimal adj.最小的, 最小限度的

**Chandler:** It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.

**Ross:** Nuh-uh.

**Chandler:** Yuh-huh.

**Ross:** So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?

**Chandler:** Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear内衣裤. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?

**Ross:** (sheepish＝shy害羞的，羞怯的，懦弱的) No.

**Chandler:** Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?

> fabric n.织品, 织物, 布, 结构, 建筑物, 构造/fabric softener衣物柔软剂

**Ross:** Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my *Snuggles*? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.

> snuggle n.偎依牌柔软剂/sensitive adj.敏感的, 灵敏的, 感光的/fuzzy adj.有绒毛的，模糊的, 失真的/ Sensitive是敏感的、灵敏的意思，注意一下其他同根词，sensible是明智的、有判断力的意思，sensational是轰动的、耸人听闻的意思；这里Ross听到Chandler说他的柔顺剂不好时候，进行了反驳，他说“我现在用的柔顺剂又怎么不好了？这表明我是很灵敏、亲切的人啊，就像毛毛熊一样。”pick up的用法也很多，这里是（随便）买的意思。

**Chandler:** There you go好的走吧.

> There you go口语中也很常见，可用Here/There sb go的句式概括，一般就是表示赞同、赞赏的意思或者相当于here/there you are。

[Scene: A fancy restaurant, Joey and Monica are there, meeting Angela and Bob, who Monica thinks is Angela's brother.]

**Monica:** Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?

**Joey:** Yep.

**Monica:** Which?

**Joey:** Which what?

**Monica:** You've never met Bob, have you?

**Joey:** No, but he's...

**Monica:** Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly可怕地，非常地...

(Angela and Bob walk in. Bob is good-looking帅气的.)

**Angela:** Hey, Joey.

**Monica:** ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up住口 now.

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Phoebe are there, both ready to break up with their significant others.]

**Chandler:** Where are they? Where are they?

**Phoebe:** This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.

**Chandler:** It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies碾过几只小狗

**Phoebe:** Eww, I don't wanna do that.

(Janice and Phoebe's boyfriend, Tony, walk in.)

**Chandler:** Here we go.

**Phoebe:** Ok, have a good break-up.

**Chandler:** Hey, Janice.

**Janice:** Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.

> supremely adv.无上地，崇高地

**Chandler:** Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso浓咖啡 and a latte over here, please?

**Janice:** We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...(looks through her bags)... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...

> proof n.照片样张/photo shoot n.像馆/sucked adj.烂透了/blow off the day打发白天的时间

(Chandler sees Phoebe breaking up with Tony. She talks to him for a few seconds, hugs him, and then he leaves. Chandler is amazed how easy it was for her.)

**Chandler:** What?

**Janice:** What?

**Chandler:** (covering) What... did you get me there?

**Janice:** I got you...these. (pulls out a pair of socks)

**Chandler:** Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.

**Janice:** Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured认为, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.

(Chandler walks over to the counter where Phoebe is, and is asking her about the break-up.)

**Chandler:** That's it?

**Phoebe:** Yeah, it was really hard.

**Chandler:** Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal残忍的

**Phoebe:** Ok, you weren't there.你不在场就别胡说

> you weren't there:是老美常用的话,直译是"你又不在那里",实际的意思是"你又没看到","你又不知道",言下之意是"你无权评论你不知道的事情",其实chandler看到了整个过程,但由于有几米的距离间隔,所以phoebe认为她自己仍然可以理直气壮的说"u weren't there".

[Scene: The Launderama, Rachel is there, waiting for Ross. An old woman takes Rachel's clothes off the machine and begins loading it with her things.]

> load v.往(洗衣机内)装衣服

**Ross:** So?

**Rachel:** Well, you know, no suds, no save.

**Ross:** No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend's machine.

**Woman:** Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.

**Ross:** Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.

(The woman and Ross stare at each other. Finally she takes her stuff out of the machine and leaves.)

**Ross:** (to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry.

> Laundromat n.<美>自助式洗衣店

**Rachel:** Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me被你逮到了. I'm a laundry virgin.

**Monica:** (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow up?

**Angela:** BrooklynHeights高地

**Bob:** Cleveland.

> 乔伊为了骗莫尼卡参加他和前女友安杰拉以及安杰拉现任男友鲍勃的四人约会，告诉莫尼卡安杰拉和鲍勃是兄妹。但当莫尼卡问他们在哪里长大时，鲍勃回答在俄亥俄州的克利夫兰(Cleveland)，而安杰拉则说在纽约的布鲁克林高地(Brooklyn Heights)，两者相去不近。所以莫尼卡问：怎么会这样?

**Monica:** How, how did that happen?

**Joey:** Oh my god.

**Monica:** What?

**Joey:** I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not现在好了

**Commercial Break**

[Scene: Fancy restaurant, Joey and Bob are talking.]

**Joey:** So, you and Angela, huh?

**Bob:** Yep是的. Pretty much几乎，非常接近，差不多.

**Joey:** You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.

> nibble n.细咬, 轻咬, 啃v.一点一点地咬, 细咬, 吹毛求疵/nibbly noise 轻啃声/weasel n.[动]鼬鼠, 黄鼠狼,

**Bob:** Huh, I never really noticed.

**Joey:** Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for倾听 it.

**Bob:** Monica, Monica is great.

**Joey:** Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.

[Scene: The ladies' bathroom at the restaurant, Monica and Angela are talking.]

**Monica:** I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific棒极了.

**Angela:** Yeah, isn't he?

**Monica:** It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.

> emotional age n.感情成熟年龄./首先注意一个词组emotional age是“感情成熟年龄”的意思，人的年龄是否真的分为心理年龄和实际年龄啊？如果那样子的话，我看几个老友们的心理年龄估计也只有20来岁。这里Monica对于别人的男朋友几乎一见钟情，说他聪明潇洒、幽默风趣、成熟稳重。/注意到前面有个beyond吗？这句话其实Mon有包含讽刺现在的男人都很幼稚，幼稚的就像是……8岁以下的小男孩，没有哪个像这个男的一样有成熟的心智，所以应该翻译为“真是太棒了，他既聪明又风趣，并且心智还成熟得，超过时下的那些……大约像8岁的小男生”

**Angela:** You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.

**Monica:** Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity贞洁.

**Angela:** Huh. That's nice.

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is coaching Chandler on how to break up with Janice.]

**Phoebe:** Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.

> pull off a Band-aid揭开护创贴/ pull off是努力实现、赢得的意思，这里则是用了本意把绷带纱布拉掉的意思。Chandler还在犹豫怎么开口，Phoebe告诉他快刀斩乱麻。

(Chandler walks back to couch, where Janice is.)

**Chandler:** Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.

**Janice:** All right. Well, there you go. (she gets extremely wound up受伤的, and begins to try and calm herself down) Stop it, stop it, stop it.

[Scene: The laundromat.]

**Rachel:** Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.

**Ross:** That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh.

> go off (蜂鸣器，微波炉等定时装置)预定的时间到了

**Rachel:** What uh-oh?

**Ross:** (not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done衣服洗好了. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.

**Rachel:** Ross, what's the matter?

**Ross:** Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.

**Rachel:** Come on, show me.

**Ross:** All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.

**Rachel:** Oh, everything's pink.

**Ross:** Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.

**Rachel:** Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!

> marsh n.沼泽，湿地/peep n.窥看, 隐约看见vi.窥视, 偷看/marshmallow peep n.小粉猪=chick,weak无用之人，胆小鬼，懦夫/ except it didn’t”可以当作固定用法记下，意思是“才不是呢”，或者学学港台普通话翻译成“哪有？”，似乎有点撒娇的意思在里面了。Marshmallow peep是mashmallow的一种，样子像小鸡。Marshmallow除了药用蜀葵的意思外，在俚语中还有“胆小懦弱、办事没有效率、做事不起作用的人”的意思，另外，还有“棉花糖”的意思呢 / marshmallow peep :Originally,Marshmallow Peep is a kinda marshmallow figured as a little chicken, but now it comes in all kinds of colors, sizes and shapes. Believe it or not, Marshmallow Peeps is celebrating its 50th Anniversary in 2003. marshmallow就是棉花糖marshmallow peep是一个品牌，是人们在复活节，情人节，万圣节，圣诞节等节日上吃的点心，应该是棉花糖之类的，做成小鸡、小兔或南瓜等各种形状象征节日 /流氓兔子Mashimaro(外号流氓兔),是从英文Marshmallow(棉花糖)的幼儿发音而来的

(The woman who had tried to steal the washing machine walks by, and laughs.)

[Scene: The fancy restaurant, Angela has her hand in Bob's shirt, and Monica is very uncomfortable.]

**Monica:** Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?

> inflate vt.使膨胀, 使得意, 使(通货)膨胀, 使充气vi.充气, 膨胀/ flop n.砰然落下, 笨重地摔, 猛落vt.笨拙地抛下/inappropriate adj.不合适的，不恰当的/ underdog:是个著名的卡通形象,每年都有这个巨大的underdog的气球在街上游行。monica的话是："Underdog狗"气球出了意外，他们无法使它的头充气膨胀。总之，嗯，它的头就好像要跌落在百老汇大街上了，我想这实在是......太不像话了（这里指的是mon看到Angela has her hand in Bob's shirt 心想这太inappropriate了，就说出来了，并不指狗头的事情） 嗯，有东西跑进我眼睛里了，乔依，能到灯下帮我看看吗?

(Her and Joey walk away from the table.)

**Monica:** Oh my god.

**Joey:** What?

**Monica:** Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.

> cocktail n.鸡尾酒会/Appalachia n.阿巴拉契亚[美国东部一地区]/ Appalachia是美国东部的山区，比较保守，在那里出现鸡尾酒就像可就像乱伦一样了，monica只是有点夸张的比喻那“兄妹”的行为。

**Joey:** Come on, they're close.

**Monica:** Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.

**Joey:** Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.

> rambunctious adj.粗暴的, 骚乱的, 难控制的

**Monica:** Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, is it?

**Joey:** Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...

**Monica:** Oh my god, what were you thinking?

**Joey:** All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.

**Monica:** (hits him lightly) Oh!

**Joey:** Ow!

**Monica:** (leaving) I'm outta here.

**Joey:** Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.

**Monica:** Really?

**Joey:** Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.

> put our head together共同想办法/break sb up将sb拆散

[Time lapse, Monica accidentally spilled her drink on Bob's shirt and is wiping it off. Joey is making eyes at Angela.]

> spill v.溅出/make eye at v.使眼色，放电
