[Scene Central Perk, everyone's there.]

**Monica:** What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.

**Joey:** Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?

**Phoebe:** Oh, yeah!

**Rachel:** Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.

> in that a.因为，由于b.既然 to 在那
> Everything you need to know is in that first kiss： 几个好朋友在一起聊性的话题，Monica说男人不懂接吻的重要性，Joey根本不屑一顾，于是Rachel说了这样一句话，意思是：初吻可以让你明白一切。

**Monica:** Absolutely.

**Chandler:** Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.

> sit through v.一直挺到结束, 耐着性子看完(或听完)/ Pink Flovd 平克·弗洛伊德(Pink Floyd)是美国著名的歌手，他演唱的《白色圣诞》脍炙人口。中钱德勒等人在讨论男女对接吻的不同看法。钱德勒说，对于男人来说，接吻就像平克·弗洛伊德出场前进行垫场演出的喜剧演员似的(It's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out．)。/Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out： Chandler也发表了自己的观点，他说接吻很大程度上像是序幕（an opening act）,像是你听Pink Floyd的音乐会之前不得不忍受的笑星们的表演一样。Pink Floyd是美国一支很著名的乐队。能听出Chandler的潜台词吧？

**Ross:** Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.

**Chandler:** The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.

**Rachel:** Yeah, well, word of advice建议如下: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.

> chan用类比，show对应sex，comedian对应first kiss，fighting traffic 我想是指男人面对女人总要找 more feelings of first kiss than sex， basically just trying to stay awake 我想是指男人通常就会搞得很没心情；rach用comedian对应first kiss，listening to that album对应sex

**Joey:** (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?

> 确实是很Blue，不过我觉得Friends最吸引人的地方之一就是以一种很随意戏谑的态度讨论性的问题，很轻松很愉快(而且我觉得还算比较健康了)。我也问过一些美国朋友，现实生活中他们也不会象那帮家伙那样谈性的问题跟吃点心一样随意的，毕竟这是很隐私的问题。

**Opening Credits**

[Scene: Museum of Prehistoric History史前历史博物馆, Ross and a co-worker (Marsha) are setting up an exhibit which includes some mannequins of cave people.]

> mannequin n. 服装模特儿, 人体模型

**Ross:** No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?

**Marsha:** Well, she has issues她有点困扰（的事情）.

> Well, she has issues: Issues在这里是烦恼、问题的意思，以后碰到别人好像闷闷不乐的时候，你就可以上前来上一句Do you have any issues?

**Ross:** Does she.

**Marsha:** He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!

> bang v.重击/over the head v.使某人不能理解/club n.重击，打击/mastodon n.乳齿象
> “He's out ”在这里表状态，表示“他在外面……”，后面“banging other women over the head with a club”是他在外面所干的事。一般口语中常常会忽略语法，所以如果死抠语法，会发现很多不合语法的地方的。整句翻译“他在外头乱搞女人，而她却待家里设法去除地毯上乳齿象的味道”。 这里CLUB不是一般俱乐部的意思，这里的CLUB是打击的意思 。/ 他在外头用棍子痛击其他女人的脑袋，而她却坐在家里想方设法地让野象闻到地毯的味道。这话什么意思？有点让人莫名其妙。好像是想说两口子不合拍，但是感觉这样理解理由也不是很充分，为什么打的是other women，而不是other men。茫然…… 这里该是Masha和Ross调侃的一段话，没有什么特殊含义，可是Ross却非常较劲儿，居然真的和Masha讨论起来究竟那些Mannequin所代表的原始人的烦恼起来，还说他们应该真正担心的是冰河世纪的到来......真不接风情，还好这时候Carol来了，解了Masha的围。

**Ross:** Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?

> gee int.(驾驭马牛等的吆喝声)向右!, 前进!快！, 惊讶时所发声音/glacier n.冰川，冰河

**Marsha:** Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife前妻?

> speaking of issues直译为“谈到问题，……”就可以了，这是马莎要引起下一句所用的一个小转折而已。

(Carol, Ross's ex-wife, has entered behind them and is standing outstide the exhibit.)

**Ross:** (trying to ignore her) No. No.

**Marsha:** Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!

**Ross:** Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age在冰河期馆见.

(Marsha extis and Ross waves Carol into the exhibit.)

**Ross:**Hi.

**Carol:** So.

**Ross:** You look great. I, uh... I hate that.

**Carol:** Sorry. You look good too.

**Ross:** Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect直立... So what's new? Still, uh...

**Carol:** A lesbian?

**Ross:** Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?

**Carol:** Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-

> paranoid n.(=paranoiac)患妄想狂者，有疑心病的人adj.类似妄想狂的
> Marty's still totally paranoid：Carol去Museum里找Ross,Ross非常尴尬，于是没话找话问Carol的家人怎么看待她是Lesbian的事儿，于是Carol告诉他，马堤仍然神经兮兮的。Paranoid这个单词是类似妄想狂的意思，有点histerical的意思。

**Ross:** Why- why are you here, Carol?

**Carol:** I'm pregnant.

**Ross:** Pregnant?!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are watching *Three's Company*.]

**Chandler:** Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company三人行 where there's some kind of misunderstanding.

> episode n.情节

**Phoebe:**...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)

**Monica:** (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that你喝完这个没?

**Joey:** Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

> slow sb down使某人慢下来

**Monica:** Whose little ball of paper is this?!

**Chandler:** Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.

> ball it up a.揉成纸团b.过放荡生活

(Monica starts to fluff a pillow.)

> fluff v.抖松/pillow n.枕头

**Phoebe:** She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine!

**Monica:** Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them(指代他们的父母) any more ammunition than they already have.

> ammunition n.军火，弹药 to借口
> ammunition的本意是“军火、弹药”，这里Monica给Phoebe解释为什么她会这么在意枕头是否“松”，因为她不想让她那个挑剔的母亲又有更多口实来说她。（虽然后面她母亲还是没有放过这么一个小小的细节）

**Chandler:** Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.

> flatness n.平整

**Phoebe:** Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way这样不好.

> chaotic adj.混乱的, 无秩序的/twirly v.旋转，捻弄/chaotic and twirly慌慌张张
> 对正在弄枕头的mon说的“chaotic and twirly”其实是老美要来形容人“慌慌张张的……”的意思。（chaotic混乱的 、twirly团团转的）

**Joey:** Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.

**Monica:** That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.

> as far as……be concerned就……而言

**Chandler:** (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!

**Monica:** What?

**Chandler:** Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!

> Thigh-master n.美腿器

> Chandler突然发现他们六个人一直关心的裸男竟然买了一个健腿器，所以很惊讶的说了这句话。那个裸男一直没有露脸过，但是却一直贯穿在这个电视中，常常会因为他的一些事情让这六个人大发感慨。

**All:** Eeaagh!

(Rachel enters from her room.)

**Rachel:** Has anybody seen my engagement ring订婚戒指?

**Phoebe:** Yeah, it's beautiful.

**Rachel:** Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under the couch cushions沙发垫.)

**Phoebe:** No, look, don't touch that!

**Rachel:** Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...

> dread v.n.恐惧，担心/the girl in the veil(n.面纱, 面罩)穿着婚纱的女孩/stomp on your heart伤透了你的心

**Monica:** Easy别着急 Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we!

**Chandler**** and Joey: **Oh! Yeah!

**Joey:** Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?

**Phoebe:** Doy! Probably right before she lost it!

> duh int.[表示犹豫、不快或轻蔑等]咄/doy:first people used to say "duh" which is a sound that indicated stupidity, but for a little while, it turned into "doy" which has the same meaning. it just SOUNDS stupid.

**Chandler:** You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...

**Rachel:** I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...

**Chandler:** ...Dinah n.黛娜, 女子名?

**Rachel:** (looks at the lasagna烤宽面条 and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad...

**Monica:** You didn't.

**Rachel:** Oh, I am sorry...

**Monica:** I gave you one job我只给了你一件事干！！潜台词是：你却把它搞砸了! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)

**Rachel:** Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!

**Chandler:** Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...

**Monica:** (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it.

**Chandler:** Boys? We're going in.

(Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe start to pick through the lasagne as there's a knock on the door which Monica answers.)

**Ross:** (standing outside the door).....Hi.

**Monica:** Wow. That is not a happy hi.

**Ross:** Carol's pregnant.

**Phoebe:** (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it!

**Monica:** W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...

**Ross:** Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now你（的表情）再保持这样两小时，就会变成我现在这样。
. (He enters.)

**Chandler:** Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?

> in persepective adv.正确地, 显示在脑海中, 符合透视法地/ Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective:在片中出现的次数非常频繁，也是口语中非常实用的词语，意思是有一点儿，相当于kind of.这样的话，枕头的事就可先放在一旁?是不是，mon？” CHAN式的幽默，用来讽刺MON太紧张房间是否整洁的玩笑。

**Rachel:** Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 你打算怎么处理（面对）整件事？

> fit into 适应、协调，

**Ross:** Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.

**Phoebe:** She is so great! I miss her.

**Monica:** What does she mean by 'involved'?

**Chandler:** I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.

> presumably adv.推测起来, 大概

**Ross:** Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

> sonogram n. 语图，B超，超音波

**Rachel:** So what are you gonna do?

**Ross:** I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.

(Joey starts to eat the rest of the lasagne and everyone turns and stares at him.)

**Joey:** .....Well, this is still ruined, right?

[Scene, Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Ross are pouring wine for their parents.]

**Mrs. Geller:** Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste?

**Monica:** Curry. n.咖哩粉, 咖哩饭菜vt.用咖哩粉调味

**Mrs. Geller:** Mmmm!

**Ross:** I- I think they're great! I, I really do.

**Mr. Geller:** (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?

> have a thing for/about a.对...特别感兴趣b.特别向往[爱好]

**Mrs. Geller:** They all had a thing for him.

**Ross:** Aw, Mom...

**Monica:** I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?

**Mrs. Geller:** Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-

**Monica:** No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.

**Mrs. Geller:** Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)

**Monica:** Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?

**Ross:** Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)

**Mrs. Geller:** Oh, we're having spaghetti n.意大利式细面条! That's.... easy.

**Monica:** I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me能够减轻我的压力.

> Ross和Monica的父母来看望他们，由于从小父母就喜欢Ross（因为Ross成绩优异，为人老实，而Monica性格独立，而且那时候还很胖chubby）,所以在吃饭的时候老是无意识的讽刺Monica,于是Monica想让Ross提提自己老婆是Lesbian而且有了孩子的事儿转移注意力。Take some of the heat off sb,这里是帮Monica减轻压力的意思。

[Time Lapse, everyone is now eating.]

**Mrs. Geller:** What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.

> run into v.跑进, 撞上, 偶遇, 陷入, 达到

**Mr. Geller:** I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!

**Mrs. Geller:** Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...

> "at the altar"应该理解为“在婚礼上，在举行婚礼时”，altar这里就可以理解为”教堂“，所以这句话的意思，我认为应该是：（虽然Rachel的父母为筹备婚礼花了不少钱，而Rachel又逃婚），但是至少Rachel还有机会在举行婚礼之际离开那个男人，（言下之意，Monica到现在连个结婚还都没有）。

**Monica:** What's that supposed to mean?

**Mrs. Geller:** Nothing! It's an expression随便说说.

**Monica:** No it's not.

**Mr. Geller:** Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...

> chubby adj.丰满的, 圆胖的/puzzle n.难题，谜，拼图

[Time Lapse.]

**Mr. Geller:** Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.

> shoot fot the stars追求成功or卓越
> shoot for是争取、得到或完成的意思。老爸盖勒也似乎对女儿不太友好，他一方面赞扬Ross，一方面不忘贬低Monica,说她满足于现状不思进取，说她这样的人绝对不会得癌症…

[Time Lapse.]

**Mr. Geller:** ...And I read about these women trying to have it all拥有一切, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.

> harmonica n.口琴(Monica的小名)

**Monica:** (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?

> try desperately to 拼命地想做某事/dig her elbow into his hand 将肘部往他的手上钻/anecdote n.轶事, 奇闻，八卦/the folks n.父母

**Ross:** (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal事情是这样的. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.

(Stunned silence ensues.)

> ensue vi.跟着发生, 继起vt.(基督教《圣经》用语)追求

**Mrs. Geller:** (To Monica) And you knew about this?!

**Commercial Break**

[Scene: Central Park, everyone's there.]

**Joey:** Your folks are really that bad, huh?

**Ross:** Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.

> pros=professionals n.专家eg:Mathew plays tennis like a pro./ Ross意思是无论发生什么事，他父母最后都能把问题绕到monica身上

**Monica:** Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours.

**Ross:** Must pee. (Goes to pee.)

> pee v.n.小便

**Phoebe:** Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.

**Rachel:** You're twins?

**Phoebe:** Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type一心追求事业的那类人.

> high-powered adj.马力大的, 精力充沛的, 高性能的

**Chandler:** What does she do?

**Phoebe:** She's a waitress.

**Rachel:** All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.)

**Monica:** Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.

**Chandler:** Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.

> imaginary adj.假想的, 想象的, 虚构的

**Rachel:** The lights, please..

(Joey turns off the lights, and they all leave as Rachel starts to clean up. Ross enters from the bathroom厕所.)

**Ross:** ...How long was I in there?

**Rachel:** I'm just cleaning up.

**Ross:** D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?

**Rachel:** Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom扫帚 and sits down.)

**Ross:** Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?

**Rachel:** Oh.. a little..

**Ross:** Mm-hmm..

**Rachel:** A lot.

**Ross:** Mm.

**Rachel:** So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?

**Ross:** Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man现在他可能痛不欲生, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...

> wanna=want to,口语中常这样子简化/类似的还有gonna就是going to得意思/steer v.驾驶，掌舵/steer clear of v.避开, 绕开/steer clear of the word好好驾驭这个词/shell n.壳/terrific adj.令人恐怖的，光彩照人的的意思/terrific口语中多半用来表示赞赏,虽然它的本意是令人恐慌的，糟糕的。 Ross暗示Rach不要随便乱用“dumped”，因为他作为一个男人自尊可能会受伤害，所以虽然这样做很难，但是还是不要显得太神采飞扬。OB/GYN abbr.. =obstetrics(n.产科学)and gynaecology（n.妇科医学） 【主美】【口】妇产科学

**Rachel:** Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?

**Ross:** Got me这你可把我问倒了.

**Rachel:** Remember when we were in high school together?

**Ross:** Yeah.

**Rachel:** I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at盯着 her.) ..Ross?

**Ross:** Yes, yes!

**Rachel:** Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)

**Ross:** Me either... (He pulls up a stool凳子 so that he doesn't have to move his hand.)

[Scene: Carol's OB/GYN, Carol is waiting.]

**Ross:** (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.

> dinosaur n.恐龙

(Susan enters holding a drink.)

**Susan:** Hi.

**Carol:** Ross, you remember Susan.

**Ross:** How could I forget?

> How could I forget? 我觉得这句话应该熟记，这样你就可以咬牙切齿的对某个人，某件事说“how could I forget?”，我怎么能忘记呢？打死我也不会忘记的。可以想见Ross当时的神态了吧，真有种欲杀Susan而后快的感觉。

**Susan:** Ross.

**Ross:** (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake握手好有力. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?

**Carol:** Dr. Oberman.

**Ross:** ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-

**Ross:** Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.

**Barry:** (answering the intercom) Be right there. (To Robbie and Rachel) Be back in a sec.

(As Barry exits Robbie stares at Rachel.)

[Scene: Carol's OB/GYN, they're talking about how this is going to work.]

**Ross:** So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work这样的局面怎么解决? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?

**Carol:** Give me a 'for instance'.

**Ross:** Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?

**Carol:** Marlon-

**Ross:** Marlon?!

**Carol:** -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.

**Ross:** ...As in Mouse?

**Carol:** As in my grandmother.

**Ross:** Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse说到米妮，就会联想到老鼠. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?

**Carol:** Julia..

**Susan:** We agreed on Minnie.

**Ross:** 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches让这些打击减轻一些吧. I believe Julia's on the table就叫Julia吧..?

> punch除了打孔机的意思之外，还有打击的意思，这里应该是说，让这些打击减轻一些吧（Roll就是滚的意思，那当然是减轻了）/“on the table”是“在桌面上，公开的在讨论的范围”意思，Ross认为如果他和Carol的孩子是女儿的话，应该光明堂皇的叫做Julia.

[Scene: Barry's office, Rachel is doing her makeup in the mirror on Barry's lamp as Barry enters.]

**Barry:** Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to你近来如何?

**Rachel:** Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.

**Barry:** Well, thank you for giving it back.

(Barry and Rachel look at each other.)

**Robbie:** Hello?!

[Scene: Carol's OB/GYN, they're still arguing about what to name the baby.]

**Susan:** Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?

**Ross:** Helen Geller? I don't think so.

**Carol:** Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

**Ross:** Thank you!

**Carol:** No, I mean it's not Geller.

**Ross:** What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

**Carol:** No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.

**Ross:** Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title为什么她也有份?

**Susan:** It's my baby too.

**Ross:** Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.

> sperm n.精液, 精子, 鲸油/sperm band n.精子库

**Susan:** Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!

**Carol:** All right, you two, stop it!

**Ross:** No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.

> get a credit 得到功劳

**Carol:** Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.

> border n.边界，国界，v.接壤/border on与……接壤/abuse n.v.滥用，虐待/that border on child abuse那有虐待儿童之嫌/名字长并且奇怪会给孩子带来很多不便！可能其他同龄人会嘲笑这个孩子，给孩子心灵造成伤害，所以是虐待儿童！
> 对话中三人，Ross姓Geller, Carol姓Willick, Susan姓Bunch，才会衍生出这一串小孩该姓什么的争论。而对话中看到的Willick-Bunch或Willick-Bunch-Geller，都称“带有连字符的姓”hyphenated last name。在中国，小孩大多都是从父姓。但在欧美，可以随父母间的协议，把父母的姓用连字符"-"连接起来，成为小孩的姓。至于哪方的姓放在前，则无一定规划。所以在这段剧情里，这三个人就是在争执小孩应该那些人的姓。

**Ross:** Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.

**Susan:** Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names（=full name）, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!

> wind v.绕, 缠, 上发条, 旋紧/wind up v.卷起, 卷拢, 上紧...发条, 结束, 使振奋, 使紧张/wind up calling略称为/get his way他就得逞,随心所欲 eg:A: George is so stubborn(固执的).B: I know. He always gets his way in the end.我知道。他总是为所欲为。

**Ross:** My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-

**Dr. Oberman:** (entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?

> nausea n.反胃, 晕船, 恶心, 作呕, 极度的不快/nauseaunt adj. 引起呕吐的

**All:** Yeah. Yeah. A little.

**Dr. Oberman:** Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be准妈妈, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back..

> lie back 依靠在椅子上

**Ross:** You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.

(He turns to go, but the sound of the sonogram catches hes ear. He returns and stares at it.)

**Ross:** Oh my God.

**Susan:** Look at that.

**Carol:** I know.

**Closing Credits**

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment, everyone is watching the tape of the sonogram. Rachel is on the phone.]

**Ross:** Well? Isn't that amazing?

**Joey:** What are we supposed to be seeing here我们能从中看到什么?

**Chandler:** I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.

> The Enterprise 老友们在看罗斯儿子在卡罗尔肚子里的扫描图时，钱德勒说了一句：“我认为它将会攻击企业号(Enterprise)。”这是钱德勒在形容还在肚里的胎儿长得像外星人，因为“企业号”是美国第一架航天飞机的名字。/Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. “dunno”是don’t know的缩写，Chandler和Joey被逼着看sonogram的录像带，可是看得一头雾水，Chandler居然说似乎是胎儿要进攻了。“哥伦比亚”号是美国第一艘航天飞机，就是几个月前掉下来的那艘，也是美国曾有的五艘航天飞机之一（但是现在就剩三艘了，1986年“挑战者”爆炸）"企业号"(ENTERPRISE)是电影《星际迷航》系列里的那艘母舰,并是真实的历史原型

**Monica:** (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

**Rachel:** (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline发线 and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot贱招, but I feel **so** much better now.
