103 飞来横财 
罗斯终于发现真相：童年时的爱犬奇奇死掉了、而不是被送往农场养老，当年被父母善意的欺骗了。 
钱德戒烟失败；众人皆不满，钱德将矛头指向各人的缺点，籍此转移了注意力。 
菲比从银行得到一笔飞来横财；她去投诉，反而阴差阳错获得更多赔偿；她将钱悉数送人，对方报以一罐苏打水——开罐饮用时发现了一根拇指在里头。饮料公司赔偿给她7000美金。 
莫妮卡的新男友阿兰大受其余五人爱戴，但莫妮卡最终和他分手。 
阿兰如释重负，因为莫妮卡的五个朋友太缠人啦。

[Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Phoebe is there.]

**Phoebe:** (entering) Hi guys!

**All:** Hey, Pheebs! Hi!

**Ross:** Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go如何?

**Phoebe:** Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway他送我到地铁 and said 'We should do this again!'

**All:** Ohh. Ouch.

**Rachel:** What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?

**Monica:** Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.

> loosely adv.宽松地, 松散地/loosely translate 泛泛地解释为

**Rachel:** Since when?

**Joey:** Since always(=forever). It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.

**Chandler** **:** Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.

> date leather-wearing alchoholics与皮革族的酒徒约会/总穿着皮裤又酗酒的人，应该是很嬉皮，古怪的，和他们约会可能会有刺激的感觉。但不一定说a nice guy就是比他们差，而是觉得和他约会比较闷，只能用nice来形容了。

**Phoebe:** Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people我们该试试别人' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.

**Rachel:** And everybody knows this?

**Joey:** Yeah. Cushions the blow.

> cushion n.垫子, 软垫, 衬垫v.加衬垫/blow n.殴打, 突然的打击v.风吹, 吹气于
> Cushions the blow: 可怜的Rach问是不是只有她是颗嫩草，善解人意的Joey来了这么一句，意思是take it easy.想想看吧，cushion是垫子的意思，用垫子承接打击，当然是放轻松点的意思咯。这可以作为固定用法记下来。

**Chandler** **:** Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep对狗实施安乐死, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.

> go off v.离开, 去世, 消失

**Ross:** That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.

> send vt.送, 寄, 发送, 派遣, 打发/send sb off打发某人走，送走

**Monica:** Uh, Ross.

**Ross:** What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!

> Connecticut n.（美国）康涅狄格/chase v.n.追逐，追击
> Phoebe: Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'Phoebe同一个男人出去约会回来告诉大家，那个男人怎么和她说的。“We should do this again”，表面上好像是以后我们还应该再继续约会，其实这是dating language，往往都是反着说的。Phoebe说完之后，大家都明白了，只有可爱的Rach傻乎乎的不明所以，还在那里夸好，于是大家只好半是卖弄半是教她的举了其他一些例子。比如“It's not you'”就是“It is you”，“You're such a nice guy”意思是 “I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you”等等。恋爱中的人们想必能够理解这些吧，是不是经常听到女生说hate u？

**Chandler** **:** Oh, Satan's minions at work again...

> minion n.<贬>惟命是从的奴仆/pheo说自己得了五百块，可是她并不高兴，所以chan就讥讽地说，又是satan's minions来干坏事啦！

**Phoebe:** Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there去那里, and deal with them.

**Joey:** What are you talking about? Keep it!

**Phoebe:** It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.

**Rachel:** Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!

**Phoebe:** Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...

> take step 走的步子/skip v.跳, 蹦

(Chandler leans over the back of the couch out of sight.)

> leans over弯下身子，俯身于...之上

> karmic n.印度教中的某钟残滓/giant karmic debt业报，深重的罪过

**Chandler** **:** And this- is my reward!

**Ross:** Hold on a second等等, alright? Just think about what you went through经受 the last time you quit.

**Phoebe:** Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!

**Monica:** Alright. I'm gonna go change换衣服, I've got a date.

**Rachel:** This Alan again? How's it goin'?

**Monica:** 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.

**Joey:** So when do we get to meet the guy?

**Monica:** Let's see, today's Monday... Never.

**All:** Oh, come on! Come on!

**Monica:** No. Not after what happened with Steve.

**Chandler** **:** What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.

> monica之前在perk里谈到她前一个男友总被他们嘲笑，原因就是那个男的说话舌头不直，chan还学他说：“We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!”这次alan见面也开玩笑学着说“schho much ”，所以大家都笑了。

**Monica:** Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.

> figure out v.合计为, 计算出, 解决, 断定, 领会到 to 想清楚

**Rachel:** Well, then can we meet him?

**Monica:** Nope. Schhorry.

[Scene: Iridium, Monica and Paula are at work.]

**Monica:** I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.

> coyote n.一种产于北美大草原的小狼, 山狗/herd n.兽群，牧群
> all over adv.全部结束, 到处, 浑身, <口>完全象/all over him 这里all over him的意思是a.不喜欢，全身挑毛病/在另一集中chan对mon说 pheo is all over him ,这里有b.引诱，往身上贴的意思。原义是c.非常喜欢...，着迷，因为喜欢得不得了，所以恨不得扑上去贴着 eg:I'm all over you.我對你非常地著迷.= I have a crush on you. 这二句都是表达很喜欢某人的意思./All over somebody 還有一個很常用的用法, 我把他翻成 "三貼" 比如說你去舞廳跳舞, 看到有一對男女跳到三點都貼在一起了, 你就可以跟你的同伴說, Hey, look, the guy is dancing all over the girl. / 一字之差但是意思完全不同喔. 你要是說 I'm over you, 就是說我跟你之間完了, 我不想再和你有任何的瓜葛. 這和 I'm all over you 是完全不一樣的.

**Paula:** Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you关心你.

> As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef作为一个吃过的坏牛排比你看过的好牛排还多的人. /coyote是一种产于北美大草原的小狼，可以和hyena一起记忆。Pick off the weak members of the herd,摘取、挑选弱处下手的意思。在Paula的回答中，她先摆了一下自己的老资格“As someone who’s seen more than her fair share of bad beef”（意即作为一个见了过多臭牛排的厨师来说，别忘了，她和Monica都是厨师这重身份，这里她用bad beef比喻那些不怎么样的男人），然后告诫Monica这没什么大不了的，不是什么糟糕的事情，毕竟他们是你的朋友，在你身后帮你留神着呢。/听着，作为一个见了过多坏的牛排的厨师，我要告诉你：这不是坏事。这和中文里有人依仗自己经验丰富，开始给他人忠告时所说的——我过的桥比你走的路还长，吃的盐比你吃的饭还多。这事儿我见得多了，听我的没错。—差不多，就是表明自己下面的话具有可信度，表明自己有足够的经验来处理你所面对的困难。所以这里应该是说“我已阅坏牛肉无数” “这种事情我见多了”的意思

**Monica:** I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.

**Paula:** Well, you do realise the odds可能性 of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..

> the slim odds微乎其微的可能性
> odds这里的意思是可能的机会、几率，相当于Chance。记住一个词组odds and ends，是零碎的东西的意思，经常能看到报纸或者杂志用这个词组作为一个栏目名称。整句话翻译过来就是：如果他们永远不能见到那个家伙，你会发现（他们完全接受他的）机会几乎没有。Slim的变形slimmer这里表示非常渺茫的意思。

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is smoking out on the balcony, Phoebe is absent.]

**Joey:** Let it go, Ross.

**Ross:** Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.

**Monica:** Do you all promise?

**All:** Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!

**Monica:** (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?

(Chandler makes a 'Cross my heart' sign. It starts to rain and he taps on the window.)

> Cross my heart"保证"或者"发誓"。eg: "Billy, cross my heart, it wasn't me who broke your bicycle."eg: Honey, cross my heart, I've never looked at another woman since the first day I set eyes on you! Believe me, that's the truth!"

**Joey:** You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy小兄弟 has to stay outside!

> filter-tipped adj.有过滤嘴的

(Chandler sulkily picks up a garbage can lid and uses it as an umbrella.)

> sulk v.n.生闷气，愠怒/sulky adj.生气的/sulkily adv.愠怒地，不高兴地/garage n.车库/garbage can垃圾箱=litter bin/lid n.盖子

(Phoebe enters, walks to the couch, sits down, and begins to read a letter without saying hi.)

**Ross:** Hey, Pheebs.

**Phoebe:** 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -*football phone* as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!

> call attention to 唤起注意/credit account n.信用帐户/credit account with将……（钱）存入你的帐户

**Rachel:** What bank is this?

(The intercom buzzes.)

**Monica:** Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it?

**Alan: **(on the intercom) It's Alan.

**Joey:** (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here他来了!

(Chandler comes in, dripping wet.)

> drip n.水滴v.(使)滴下/ dripping wet adv.湿透地；湿淋淋地

**Monica:** (to all) Okay, please be good, *please*. Just remember how much you all like me.

(She opens the door and Alan enters.)

**Monica:** Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.

**Alan:** Hi.

**All:** Hi, Alan.

**Alan:** I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!

(Everyone laughs.)

[Time lapse, Alan is leaving.]

**Monica:** (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot谁先来, hmm?

> bash v.n.怒殴, 打坏, <美俚>盛会, 狂欢/Alan-bashing n.攻击Alan
> Monica: (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm? 这段话很多人讨论过，主要集中在Alan-bashing上，其实之前Monica已经是下了很大的决心要带Alan同大家见面，心里已经做好了被挖苦的准备了（之前的wine guy,还有那个说话漏风的家伙等等一定让她被讽刺的很不爽），不过这次大家总算给足了面子，包括为了抽烟而宁愿在走廊淋的浑身湿透的Chandler（dripping wet）,Monica一定觉得怪怪的，所以才会等Alan一走就面向大家：好了，现在开始Alan的批判会吧！（Alan-bashing是个有趣的组合，我们也可以用的，比如看到Antique欺负谁了，也可以来个antique-bashing嘛。“take the first shot”也值得记下，各种场合都可以用，“谁先来？”，呵呵，Antique的笔记那么臭，开批判会啦，who’s gonna take the first shot?

(Silence.)

**Monica:** C'mon!

**Ross:** ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.

> pick at v.用指尖拉, 少量地吃

**All:** Loved him! Yeah! He's great!

**Monica:** Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that *I'm* going out with?

**All:** Yeah!

**Rachel:** And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger食指.)

**The Guys:** (reluctantly) Yeah.

**Joey:** Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.

> crook n.钩状物，<美口>骗子/crooked adj.弯曲的, 拐骗的, 不老实的/kinda crooked有点邪邪的

**Phoebe:** Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!

**Ross:** ...What shoe?

**Phoebe:** From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'

> nursery n.托儿所/rhyme v.押韵n.押韵，押韵诗/nursery rhyme儿歌，童谣
> There was a crooked man 莫尼卡的男友阿兰受到了大家的好评，乔伊说他的笑容扭曲得很可爱。菲比就引用了一段儿歌，说：“曾经有一个扭曲的人(There was a crooked man)，他有一个扭曲的笑容，他生活在一只鞋子里……”事实上，这是西方流传已广的儿歌《鹅妈妈歌谣》，不过，菲比 将引文全部引错了，原文是“走在一条一英里(Mile)长的扭曲道路上”，而不是“扭曲的笑容(Smile)”；歌中人生活在“扭曲的小屋子里”，而不是生活在鞋子里。所以大家听菲 比这么一说都有点困惑。但这可能不是菲比的错，或许是菲比的妈妈一开始就教错了，还记得菲比曾经以为某部关于狗的片子真的是喜剧收场吗

(Dubious pause.)

> dubious adj.可疑的

**Ross:** ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.

> yardstick n.<美> 码尺, 准绳
> yardstick” 本身是一种丈量工具，即 “码尺、准绳”，其引申之意也就是 “衡量…的标准或尺度”,后面跟介词of或against, 比如：Is diploma the only yardstick of knowledge? Ross等几个拼命吹嘘Alan，也不知道是真的喜欢还是投Monica所好，总之Monica乐坏了。

**Rachel:** What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.

**Monica:** Really!

**Chandler** **:** Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)

> David Hasselhoff 钱德勒在夸奖莫尼卡的男友阿兰时说，就凭他“戴维·哈塞霍夫(David Hasselhoff)”般的表情，连钱德勒自己都想嫁给他。说着，钱德勒还学了一个表情。戴维·哈塞霍夫是著名的歌手兼偶像，曾主演过《霹雳游侠》和《杰克和海德》。

**Ross:** You know what I like most about him, though?

**All:** What?

**Ross:** The way he makes me feel about myself 他让我找回了自我，或意译为，和他在一起，让我重拾自信。

**All:** Yeah...

**Commercial Break**

[Scene: Central Perk, Monica is alone as Ross, Rachel, Chandler, and Joey enter dejectedly in softball gear.]

> dejectedly adv.沮丧地/softball n.垒球/gear n.齿轮，设备，装置/in softball gear穿着垒球装备

**Monica:** Hi.. how was the game?

**Ross:** Well..

**All:** WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!

**Monica:** Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?

**Joey:** Alan.

**Ross:** He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...

> bugs adj.疯狂的，发疯的/bunny n.<儿>小兔子/second base二垒
> Bugs Bunny 罗斯等和阿兰出去打球，阿兰身手矫健，在所有关键的位置上出现。罗斯形容他就像著名的动画片“兔巴哥(Bugs Bunny)”里面打垒球的“兔巴哥”，一会在一垒，一会在二垒，一会又在三垒。

**Rachel:** I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.

**Chandler** **:** Yep是的, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..

> Hassidic adj.[宗](犹太教)哈西德派的/jeweler n.珠宝商

**Monica:** Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..

**Ross:** What?

**Monica:** ..I dunno, a little too Alan?

**Rachel:** Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.

**Ross:** Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.

> innate adj.内在的/adore v.崇拜，喜爱

**Chandler** **:** I personally could have a gallon of Alan.

> a gallon of 一加仑的/a gallon of alan只是Chandler用来表达对alan喜欢程度的一个笑话罢，好像“日有三省”中的"三" 一样，并非实指多少次，而是暗指“数量多，程度深”。

[Scene: A street, Phoebe walks up to a homeless person (Lizzie) she knows.]

> homeless adj.无家的，无家可归的

**Phoebe:** Hey, Lizzie.

**Lizzie:** Hey, Weird Girl.

**Phoebe:** I brought you alphabet soup字母汤.

**Lizzie:** Did you pick out the vowels元音?

**Phoebe:** Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.)

> alphabet soup:母汤是一种罐头汤，里面是切成ABC字母图案的细面条，让小朋友边喝汤边把里面的字母排成单词来玩。而美国儿音背诵元音的口诀是：A, E, I, O, U, sometimes Y. 字母Y是半元音，有时候会当辅音使用，所以Phoebe觉得它不全然算元音，就保留在汤里了，并特意还强调 sometimes Y这个口诀。

**Lizzie:** Saltines撒盐饼干?

**Phoebe:** No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?

**Lizzie:** What? (She opens the envelope Phoebe has given her.) Oh my God, there's really money in here.

**Phoebe:** I know.

**Lizzie:** Weird Girl, what are you doing?

**Phoebe:** No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.

**Lizzie:** No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.

**Phoebe:** Oh, that's fine, no.

**Lizzie:** Would you like my tin-foil hat?

> tin n.锡/foil n.箔，金属薄片/tin-foil hat锡箔帽

**Phoebe:** No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.

**Lizzie:** Please, let me do something.

**Phoebe:** Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even我们扯平. Okay?

**Lizzie:** Okay.

**Phoebe:** Okay.

[Scene: Chandler's office, Chandler looks around, opens his desk drawer, takes a puff of a cigarette, sprays around some air freshener, and takes some breath spray. He types for a little while, opens the drawer again, and takes another drag of the cigarette. While not paying attention, he sprays the breath spray around the room, takes a squirt of air freshener and gags.]

**Lizzie:** (leaves) See ya.

(Phoebe opens the can and reacts.)

**Phoebe:** Huh!

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is telling everyone about her discovery.]

**Ross:** A *thumb*?!

(Phoebe nods.)

**All:** Eww!

**Phoebe:** I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was它就在那, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!

> hitch n.猛拉, 急推, 蹒跚, 故障vt.猛拉, 系住/hiker n.徒步旅行者/hitch-hiker n.搭便车的旅行者, 顺便插入的广告, 短篇广告/hitch-hiker是搭顺风车的人。这里Phoebs是说这个罐里飘着的大拇指就像hitch-hiker的那根大拇指。你知道，他们的标致性动作就是在招手要车时竖起thumb。

**Chandler** **:** Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?

**Phoebe:** Does, um, anyone wanna see?

**All:** Nooo!

(Chandler lights a cigarette.)

**All:** Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out停止做某事or 住手，住口!

**Rachel:** It's worse than the thumb!

**Chandler** **:** Hey, this is so unfair!

**Monica:** Oh, why is it unfair?

**Chandler** **:** So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word将每个字发得过于清晰? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing搞什么? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?

> flaw n.缺点/Big deal有什么了不起！/knuckle n.指节, 关节/knuckle-cracking扳指关节/snort n.v.喷鼻息

(An awkward silence ensues.)

**Joey:** ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?

**Rachel:** Well, I-I could live without it我觉得是有点烦（很婉转的一种表达方式）.

**Joey:** Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews咀嚼 her hair?

(Phoebe spits out吐出 her hair.)

**Ross:** Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.

> endearing adj.引起爱情的, 可爱的, 令人钟爱的

**Joey:** Oh, (Imitating Ross) "you do, do you是吗"?

(Monica laughs and snorts.)

**Ross:** You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.

**Rachel:** "**Indeed there isn't**"... I should really get back to work.

**Phoebe:** Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.

**Rachel:** Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves（n.手套）come on.

> gloves:是从一句俗语来的,其实就相当于hurt somebody。我估计是从拳击那边引过来的，as in boxing gloves/本来rachel是站在phoebe一条战线上的（she thinks phoebe's chewing hair is endearing），没想到pheobe“恩将仇报”的讽刺了她一回，Rachel觉得被出卖了，所以说phoebe has the gloves on.说有时候你还会听到类似的说法：“not lay a glove(fingure or hand) on”， which means leave unhurt.

(They degenerate into bickering and Chandler happily starts to smoke, undisturbed.)

> degenerate adj.退化的vt.退化degenerate into/退or蜕化为，堕落为/bickering n.争吵
> Flaw这里是fault、drawback或shortcoming的意思， big deal单独用在某句话中多半表示反语或者反问，用的更常见的是no big deal.意思是没什么大不了的。想想真替chandler鸣冤，中国还有很多男人不抽烟被斥为没有男人味道呢，呵呵，果然他心里不平衡了，开始数落起其它几个老友的flaw来 比如Joey没事就喜欢把指关节摁得直响(knuckle-cracking)、 Ross说起话来每个字的发音都那么铿锵有力(with his over-pronouncing every single word)、Monica笑起来会打呼噜(with that snort when she laughs),呵呵，这招就叫围魏救赵。果然在他的挑拨离间计下，其他几个马上degenerate into bickering,陷入了一场口水战中去了。

[Scene: Iridium n.[化]铱 to 饭店名称, Monica and Paula are working.]

**Monica:** Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?

**Paula:** No.

**Monica:** Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.

**Paula:** Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!

> get through度过,脱险

**Monica:** Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel *the thing*. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.

**Paula:** Honey.. you should always feel *the thing*. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!

**Monica:** I know.. it's gonna be really hard.

**Paula:** Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over熬过去it.

**Monica:** No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.

[Scene: Cental Perk, Joey and Ross are persecuting Chandler about his smoking.]

**Joey:** Do you have any respect for your body?

**Ross:** Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?

**Chandler** **:** Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.

> have had it受够了, 忍无可忍了/emphysema n.肺气肿/the bottom line is=at least

**Rachel:** (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.

Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)

**Rachel:** (to Ross, who has wandered up有点犯迷糊，纳闷) God, he's good.

**Rachel:** Yeah.

(They give each other a dubious可疑的，怀疑的 look.)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyon except Monica and Joey is watching Lambchop.]

> Lampchop n.小羊排

**Ross:** Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?

> Pop-Tart 一种上面有果酱或果陷的小圆饼

**Phoebe:** Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?

**Ross:** Hey, I might!

**Phoebe:** Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.

**All:** You're kidding. Oh my God.

**Phoebe:** And on my way over here在我来这里的路上, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!

> step in gum踩上口香糖/表示极不满就会用到hell，文明点就是on earth，再粗俗点就是 F word.What is up with ...是怎么了，因为stepped in gum跟她前面说的没什么关系，莫名其妙，所以才好笑

**Joey:** (dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going on?

**Monica:** Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.

**Joey:** Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..

**Rachel:** Uh, Joey..

**Joey:** Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.)

**Monica:** (turns off the TV) Okay..

**All:** Oh! That was Lambchop!

**Monica:** Please, guys, we have to talk.

> deja vu n.似曾相识的感觉；幻觉记忆

**Monica:** Alright, we have to talk.

**Phoebe:** There it is!

**Monica:** Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.

(They all gasp喘息 and clutch抓住 each other.)

**Ross:** Is there somebody else?

**Monica:** No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.

**Rachel:** We didn't change..

**Joey:** So that's it? It's over? Just like that?

**Phoebe:** You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair)

**Monica:** Look, I- I could go on pretending-

**Joey:** Okay!

**Monica:** -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!

**Ross:** Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.

**Monica:** I'm sorry..

**Chandler** **:** (sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!

**Rachel:** (tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-

**Monica:** I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.

**All:** Oh, yeah! Right!

**Monica:** Are you guys gonna be okay?

**Ross:** Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.

**Monica:** (dubious) I understand.

**Monica:** He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look)

**Ross:** You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her forehead.)

**Chandler** **:** ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.

**All:** No no no!
