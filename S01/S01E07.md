**The One With the Blackout**

Written by: Jeffrey Astrof and Mike Sikowitz.
Transcribed by: Ruth Curran

*107 停电 纽约全城停电。钱德碰巧被困在一间24小时ATM自助服务厅里， 名模吉儿碰巧也被困当中。 钱德有心无胆，空欢喜一场。 其余五人呆在莫妮卡和瑞秋家。 丑陋裸男点了很多蜡烛。 罗斯决心向瑞秋表白时遭到一只猫的攻击。 瑞秋和菲比替猫找寻主人，遇到“怪人”海先生（他将在今后的剧集中出现）。他声称他就是猫的主人，但显然他在撒谎。 原来猫的主人叫保路，是这栋楼里居住的意大利大块头男人，他不大会讲英语。瑞秋和保路一见钟情，打得火热。*

**Opening Credits**

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is on the phone with her mother. Phoebe, Rachel, and Ross are there.]

**Rachel:** Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!

> black out v.灯火管制, 熄灯, 停止, 中断 to停电/ Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!: “black out”停电、熄灯、停止和中断的意思，这一集一开始，整个纽约市都断电了，还真是酷耶。关于black还有一些词组需要掌握，black and white:白纸黑字，类似的还有混淆是非（call/make black white）;bule and white青一块紫一块；black book/list 黑名单等等。

**Monica:** Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.

**Rachel:** Wow, you guys, this is big.

**Monica:** (into phone) Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. (hangs up)

[Scene: ATM vestibule, Jill Goodacre is on the cellular phone手机. Chandler's thoughts are in italics斜体字.]

**Chandler:***Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.*

**Jill:** (on phone) Hi Mom, it's Jill.

**Chandler****:***She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! *(pause)* Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, \**that** is the part to focus on,** you idiot**!*

> vestibule n.前厅/atrium n.中厅

**Jill:** (on phone) Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.

**Chandler****:***Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.*

**Jill:** (on phone) I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.

**Chandler****:***Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was \**some guy**.*

(Chandler strides proudly across the vestibule and Jill stares at him.)

**Joey:** Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.

> Jewish adj.犹太人的, 犹太族的/Chanukah n.光明节(犹太人一纪念节日)
> 光明节与九座烛台:光明节为期八天，约在每年十二月初，是为了纪念当初犹太祖先夺回耶路撒冷圣殿，当时在圣殿献灯的灯油，原本只能燃烧一天，最后却燃烧了八天的奇迹。犹太人会从光明节第一天起，在九座烛台上依次由右至左，一天插上一支蜡烛，直到第八天八根蜡烛一起为止，而中央的蜡烛则是专供引火之用。过节期间，亲友都会团聚一堂，目睹点燃烛火并一起祷告。而Joey 把这些具有宗教意义的烛台点燃，只为了应付停电之需，跟它本身神圣的意义形成强烈的对比，所以Ross 才开玩笑称他为“犹太教士（拉比）”Rabbi。

**Phoebe:** (at window) Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.

(They all look at the window, grossed out***, then flinch in pain.)

> gross adj.总的, 毛重的n.总额/flinch vi.畏缩, 退缩, 畏首畏尾n.退缩, 畏缩

(Chandler smiles at her, she smiles back sweetly.)

**Chandler****:***There you go!*

(He continues to smile like an idiot, and she looks frightened.)

**Chandler****:***You're definitely scaring here.*

**Jill:** (awkwardly) Would you like to call somebody? (offering phone)

**Chandler****:***Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.* Yeah, thanks. (takes phone)

> went to准备做,有助于

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, The phone rings; it's Chandler.]

**Monica:** Hello?

**Chandler****:** Hey, it's me.

**Monica:** (to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?

**Chandler****:** Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up掩盖what he is saying) I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth **Jll Gdcr**.

**Monica:** What?

**Chandler****:** I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth **Jll Gdcr**!

**Joey:** What's up man?

> pool n.撞球/pool table n.有六个落袋的撞球台./ Monica: OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.常常在英语角碰到人介绍自己时候说是Grade one or two之类的，其实大学几年级有更地道的说法，freshman->一年级，sophomore->二年级，junior->三年级，senior->大四，研究生是postgraduate,博士生是phd，还有人往往介绍自己直博了，个人认为如下说法比较合适:be nominated to be a phd candidate directly,在有些学校介绍硕博连读的网页上，还有如下表述direct-promotion program for PHD diploma..还常常有ABD来代表在读的博士生或者准博士。值得注意的是国外大学一般很少有授予硕士学位，不像国内。

**All:** Whoooaa!

**Ross:** That's my sister.

**Joey:** OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room女厕所 on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.

**Monica:** Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?

**Ross:** Pheebs, what about you?

**Phoebe:** Oh... Milwaukee.

**Rachel:** Um... Ross?

**Ross:** Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'

> It's a Small World After All:这是迪斯尼乐园“奇幻王国”的一个旅游项目“小世界”，人们坐着船顺着水道漂行，岸两边有机械控制的小人载歌载舞，服装和背景反映世界各国的风貌。剧中罗斯回忆自己最古怪的做爱地点时选择了这里，1989年他和卡罗尔去迪斯尼，因为机械故障，“小世界”停了下来，罗斯就和卡罗尔爬到一群荷兰小人后面去做爱，但就在这个过程中，机械故障被修好了。结果是：罗斯和卡罗尔成为“奇幻王国”不受欢迎的人，被要求再也不许去那里玩。

**All:** No way!

**Ross:** The ride骑马设施 broke down出故障. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of两个，几个 those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the MagicKingdom.

> Dutch n.荷兰人, 荷兰语adj.荷兰的, <俚> 德国的, 条顿民族的

**Phoebe:** Oh, Rachel.

**Rachel:** Oh come on, I already went.

**Monica:** You did not go!

**All:** Come on.

**Rachel:** Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, the foot of the bed床角.

**Ross:** Step back请退后.

**Joey:** We have a winner!

[Time lapse, Ross and Rachel are talking, Joey is on the couch, and Monica and Phoebe are out of the room.]

**Rachel:** I just never had a relationship（恋爱）关系 with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there你突然感到欲火中烧, in the middle of a theme park.

> theme park n.（游乐园中的）主题乐园

**Ross:** Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.

**Rachel:** There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf小小高尔夫 course.

**Ross:** Come on.

**Rachel:** No, he said we were holding up阻挡 the people behind us.

**Ross:** (sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?

**Rachel:** I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...

**Ross:** Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated激情被过度重视.

> overrate v.对……估价过高/ Passion is way overrated:Rachel说了自己对于Passion的看法，Ross认为她过高估计了Passion,什么是Passion?Passion是一种非常强烈的感情，炽热的激情，不仅仅是喜爱，也可以是憎恨、厌恶。例如：He's been known to fly into a passion without warning.意思是他以动不动就发火而闻名。Way overrated,overrate对什么估计高了，前面加上一个way，就是估计的过高了的意思，way这里作副词，表示远远地、大大地。记得在《Sleepless in Seattle》里面，出现了一个way stupid，意思是太蠢了，蠢的够可以。

**Rachel:** Yeah right.

**Ross:** It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.

> burn out v.烧坏, 烧掉, 烧尽/security n.安全感/lesbianism n.女同志主义，女性同性恋关系/miss out遗漏

**Rachel:** (sigh) OK.

**Ross:** But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.

**Rachel:** You don't.

**Ross:** Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.

**Rachel:** Really?

**Ross:** Mmmm.

**Rachel:** You do?

**Ross:** I do.

**Rachel:** Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)

> playfully adv开玩笑地/rub v.擦，摩擦

(Ross gets up, pleased with himself.)

**Joey:** It's never gonna happen.

**Ross:** (innocently无罪地，天真地，单纯地) What?

**Joey:** You and Rachel.

**Ross:** (acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?

**Joey:** Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the **friend zone**朋友区.

**Ross:** No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.

**Joey:** Ross, you're mayor市长 of the zone.

**Ross:** I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...

> priesthood n.教士, 僧侣, 神父/end up stuck in以陷在……告终

**Ross:** I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him) What? What, now?
