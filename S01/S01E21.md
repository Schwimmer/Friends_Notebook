**Joey:** How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?

> get (a) hold of v.抓住, 得到

**Monica:** I have no idea. But look how much they spent!

> calm down v.平静下来，镇定下来

**Monica:** I know. It's just such reckless spending.

> reck v.顾虑，介意/reckless adj.不计后果的/reckless spending挥霍无度

**Ross:** I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution（v.警告n.谨慎小心） to the wind将警惕抛在风中，也就是毫无警惕。.

**Chandler****:** Wow, what a geek混帐. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop拖把.

**Monica:** That's me.

**Phoebe:** Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)

**Ross:** What? It's, it's just a phase.

> phase n.阶段（=stage），状态，相位

**Chandler****:** Well, that's what we said about Joey...

**Ross:** Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.

**Rachel:** (Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!

**Ross:** What?

**Rachel:** Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.

> Curious George罗斯养的猴子马塞尔进入了发情期，它冲入瑞秋的房间，瑞秋赶去拯救已经不及，她的“好奇乔治”玩偶已经被马塞尔“欺负”了。“好奇乔治”是一款猴子玩具，因此马塞尔被吸引“干了坏事”。

**Opening Credits**

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, late at night Monica is still examining her bill as Rachel emerges from her room.]

**Rachel:** Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing你对此事还是无法释怀.

**Monica:** This woman's living my life.

**Rachel:** What?

**Monica:** She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.

> intimidate v.胁迫/art supplies n.艺术品

**Rachel:** You're not an artist.

**Monica:** Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.

**Rachel:** Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.

**Monica:** Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.

**Rachel:** (Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...

**Monica:** Do I go horseback riding骑马 in the park? Do I take classes at the NewSchool?

> New School:新学派。街舞通常被分为两大学派：新学派和旧学派。新学派强调团体的合作，旧学派则体现个人的表演。Normally, hip-hop street dance can be divided into two genres, i.e. NewSchool and Old School. The former one stresses the cooperative showdown of the whole team, while the latter one places the individual performance on the priority.

**Rachel:** (Yawning) Nooo...

**Monica:** This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names舞台艺名.]

**Chandler****:** Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?

**Monica:** Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were哪些课.

**Phoebe:** What are you doing?

**Monica:** (Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tap class.

> hush v.（使）安静下来,做出嘘的手势/tap n.轻打，轻拍 to 踢踏舞

**Rachel:** What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?

**Monica:** This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.

**Rachel:** Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.

> be lost in全神贯注于，沉湎于，不胜...之至/obsession n.迷住，困扰/ you're kinda losing it here有点失控，有点失去理智。Mon通过信用卡清单查到假Monica去了tap class，踢踏舞学习班，所以她想跟踪看一下假Monica的模样。

**Phoebe:** This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, **for the love of God, Monica, don't do it**!! ...Thank you.

[Scene: A Tap Class, the girls are standing at the door.]

**Monica:** What d'you think?

**Phoebe:** Lotsa things.

(They go in and sit down.)

**Rachel:** Which one do you think she is?

(The teacher comes up to them.)

**Teacher:** May I help you?

**Monica:** Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.

**Teacher:** You don't observe a dance class. You **dance** a dance class. Spare(adj.多余的) shoes are over there.

**Rachel:** What does she mean?

**Phoebe:** I think she means (Imitates) 'You **dance** a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. (They put on some spare shoes)

> imitate vt.模仿

**Monica:** Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?

**Teacher:** (To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers优格空瓶 lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!

**Rachel:** She could be you.

(Music starts)

**Teacher:** Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...

(Everyone starts to dance in unison. Monica flounders)

> unison n.调和, 和谐, 一致, 齐唱, 齐奏/flounder vi.(在水中)挣扎, 困难地往前走, 踌躇, 发慌

**Monica:** Great. It's gym体育馆 class all over again.

**Teacher:** Well that's all right, you can come up to the front到前头来 and dance with me.

**Monica:** Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.

(She starts to walk very slowly toward the front of the room. The teacher grabs her hand and pulls her. Suddenly a woman bursts in)

**Woman:** It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense紧张的 girl?

**Teacher:** She's your partner.

**Woman:** Hi. I'm Monica.

**Monica:** Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.

**Woman:** (Fake Monica) Monana?

**Monica:** Yeah. It's Dutch荷兰语.

**Fake Monica:** You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her something in Dutch)

> Amsterdam n. n.阿姆斯特丹(荷兰首都)

**Monica:** Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.

> Pennsylvania Dutch：德裔宾州人非荷兰人。Dutch是“荷兰语的，荷兰人的”；而Pennsylvania Dutch则是指“德裔宾州人”，或他们说的一种夹杂英语的德语。因为十八世纪的德国有一个基督教派“门诺教派”叫做the Amish, 信徒们不堪其它教派排挤，移民到现今美国宾州东部，过自己理想的生活。直到今天这群德裔宾州人依旧维持祖先传统，他们保持自己的服饰，不接受正统教育，也远离所有科技产品，社区里过着自给自足的农业生活，家家户户虔诚信仰上帝。 
> 这里因为Monica一开始说她是荷兰人，但对方马上和她讲荷兰话，她转不过来只好说自己是德裔宾州人。所以之后假Monica带她四处玩乐享受生活，Monica觉得新奇之际，假Monica也不断提醒那是因她是德裔宾州人，没见过世面之故。

**Teacher:** And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...

[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is entering.]

**Ross:** (Mortified) Hi.

**Chandler**** and Joey:** Hey.

**Joey:** Where've you been?

**Ross:** I just got back from the vet.

> vet n.兽医v.诊疗, 作兽医

**Chandler****:** She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?

> cone n.锥形物, 圆锥体to手套

**Ross:** She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity性成熟.

**Joey:** (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.

> He beat ya:Beat: be superior，战胜。Ross说Marcel已经到达成熟期，需要交配了。而Chandler正好没有女朋友，所以Joey对他说，在这点上，Marcel比他强。

**Ross:** She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.

> as time goes on随着时间的推移

**Chandler****:** So what does this mean?

**Ross:** I'm gonna have to give him up.

**Commercial Break**

[Scene: Central Perk, scene continued from earlier. They guys are sitting there like the Three Monkeys.]

**Joey:** I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks这太扯了吧!

**Chandler****:** I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?

**Ross:** I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg紧抱着我腿的小东西.

**Joey:** Isn't there any way you can keep him?

**Ross:** No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.

> have access to有途径得到/vicious adj.恶的, 不道德的, 恶意的, 刻毒的, 堕落的, 品性不端的, 有错误的

**Joey:** How do you get a monkey into a zoo?

**Chandler****:** I know that one! ...No, that's Popes(教皇) into a *Volkswagen**（大众汽车）*.

> popes into a volkswagen :Chandler这句话该是针对Joey所说的，所以有必要看一下Joey的话： 
> Joey: How do you get a monkey into a zoo? Chandler: I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen. Pope是教皇，Volkswagen是很大众的车，教皇怎么可能屈尊做大众呢？不过Marcel虽然是Ross最亲密的伙伴，也摆脱不了他是只小猴的命运。猴子进动物园是很理所当然的事情，而Joey却问了这么白的问题，所以Chandler调侃他说了Popes into a Volkswagen.言下之意，Joey你在说什么呢？Marcel不过是只猴子罢了，拜托别弄得他像教皇一样好吗！ 在西方人的文化中：there is often a joke about "How can you get a ____ into a volkswagen.... "

**Ross:** Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.

> apply to v. a.应用于b.向……申请/pipe dream n.白日梦, 幻想/pipe dream:它和用水烟袋吸食大麻关系不大。但是，这个习语确实和鸦片有一定的渊源。在18、19世纪的英国，即使在受过良好教育的上流社会，吸食鸦片也并不罕见。比如，英国湖畔诗人塞谬尔·柯勒律治曾在吸食鸦片后，在梦幻般的意境中写出名诗《忽必烈汗》。当时人们一旦吸食鸦片成瘾，就被叫做on the pipe。而pipe dream则用来比喻鸦片上瘾者陷入幻想的那种感觉。大约在1895年，pipe dream出现在书本上，表示“奇异或愚蠢的想法”， 但其口头用法的流行很可能要更早些。

**Chandler****:** Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo疯狂动物园.

(Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel enters.)

**Phoebe:** Hey. We found her, we found the girl.

**Chandler****:** What?

**Joey:** Did you call the cops<俚>警察?

**Rachel:** Nope. We took her to lunch.

**Chandler****:** Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice你们自己标榜为代表正义的义务警员，.

> vigilante n.义务警员

**Ross:** What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.

**Monica:** Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.

> astound v.使震惊/astounding person n.奇人

**Ross:** Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader啦啦队队长.

**Chandler****:** ...Take off their hats!

**Phoebe:** Popes in a *Volkswagen*! ...I love that joke.

> 脑筋急转弯：How do you get Popes in a Voltswaggon?回答是Take off their hats。知道为什么吗？因为教皇的帽子很高。

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel and Fake Monica are there.]

**Rachel:** No way不可能. No way did you do this.

**Fake Monica:** Monana was very brave.

**Monica:** It was so wild疯狂的. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!

> Gunnersens：姓Gunnersen的人。用法类似the Carpenters，那个著名的卡本特兄妹组合乐队/ Boston Celtics：篮球队的队名，中国翻译为波士顿凯尔特队。Monica告诉酒店的人他们是615房的冈氏姐妹，结果后来才知道波士顿凯尔特队当时已经包下了(take over)整个六楼。

**Fake Monica:** So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...

**Monica:** ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of轰出 a hotel! Me!

**Rachel:** Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)

> wait up v.不睡觉地守侯,停下来等候=deliberately do not go to bed because of waiting someone else特意等某人

**Fake Monica:** Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.

> be auditioning for 去……试镜

**Monica:** 'Scuse me?

**Fake Monica:** There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?

> call: a summoning(n.召集) of actors to rehearsal试演，排练

**Monica:** Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.

**Fake Monica:** Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.

**Monica:** What?

**Fake Monica:** Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

**Monica:** Right. Till I bought a blow dryer吹风机, then I was shunned.

> shun v.避免，避开,逃避/be shunned =expel from a community or group，被逐出。eg:Materialists face truth, whereas idealists shun it.唯物主义者面向真理, 唯心主义者则逃避真理。

**Fake Monica:** I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see *Dead Poets' Society*?

> Dead Poets' Society:盗用莫尼卡信用卡的假莫尼卡告诉莫尼卡，她最喜欢的电影是《死亡诗社(Dead Poets'Society)》，这本电影改变了她的生活，这是罗宾·威廉姆斯主演的一本电影，描写一个教师如何改变了一个学校的古板风气，但最后又自杀的故事。这个故事显然太深奥了,所以莫尼卡就没好意思说自己最喜欢的是罗宾·威廉姆斯的另外一本搞笑片《窈窕奶爸(Mrs．Doubtfire)》。

**Monica:** Uh-huh.

**Fake Monica:** I thought that movie was so incredibly... **boring**. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play话剧? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap（n.垃圾，废物） I was afraid to do.

**Monica:** Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend *Mrs. Doubtfire*.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, tiem lapse. Everyone but Joey and Monica are there.]

**Ross:** (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.

**Phoebe:** I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.

> brunt n.冲击，冲势/take the brunt受到冲击

**Ross:** Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?

**Rachel:** Oh, somebody will.

**Joey:** (entering) You know there already **is** a Joseph Stalin?

**Chandler****:** You're kidding.

**Joey:** Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!

> dicatate v.口述, 口授, 使听写, 指令, 指示, 命令, 规定/dicatation n.听写/dictator n.独裁者, 独裁政权执政者, 口授令他人笔录者/slaughter n.v.屠宰, 残杀, 屠杀

**Chandler****:** Y'know, you'd think I would've.

**Joey:** Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?

**Phoebe:** ...Flame Boy.

> flame boy，pheo给joey的名字，这个名字给人gay的感觉，

[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is talking to Dr. Baldhara, a zookeeper动物园管理者.]

**Ross:** Where exactly is your zoo?

**Dr. Baldhara:** Well, it's technically not a zoo per se本质上, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?

> interactive adj.互动的，交互式的

**Ross:** Yes.

**Dr. Baldhara:** Does he, uh, fight with other animals?

**Ross:** No-no, he's, he's very docile.

> docile (=tame)adj.听话的, 容易教的, 驯良的, 温顺的

**Dr. Baldhara:** Even if he were... cornered?

**Ross:** Well I, I don't know. Why?

**Dr. Baldhara:** Uh, how is he at handling small objects?

> be at 做，从事于

**Ross:** He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...

**Dr. Baldhara:** How about a hammer, or a small blade刀片?

**Ross:** Why- why- why would he need a blade?

**Dr. Baldhara:** Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns角, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.

> be up against vt.(暗指在危险的情况下)面对面临/jungle cat丛林猫

(Chandler and Joey burst in, with Marcel)

**Chandler**** and Joey:** He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.

> San Diego Zoo：位于美国加州的著名动物园。里面最著名的是熊猫馆。

**Joey:** We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...

**Chandler****:** ...He's in.

**Ross:** He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!

**Dr. Baldhara:** You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains利润.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is dusting打扫. She comes to the table, lifts抱起 all the magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. Monica bursts in, obviously drunk.]

**Monica:** Yo- hooo!

**Rachel:** Where the hell've you been?

**Monica:** Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.

> crash：未被邀请而参加/embassy n.大使馆/ambassador n.大使

**Rachel:** Are you drunk?!

**Monica:** Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.

**Rachel:** Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...

(Monica is drinking from the tap水龙头)

**Rachel:** Monica? Monica!

**Monica:** Water rules!真过瘾

**Rachel:** Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up出现 for work?

**Monica:** Nope. Going to the *Big Apple Circus* today.

> circus n.马戏团，马戏表演

> Big Apple Circus 莫尼卡被假莫尼卡蛊惑，决定过自己想过的生活，上班都不去上，而是去看大苹果马戏团(Big Apple Circus)和到冬园剧场(Wintergarden Theater)去看歌舞剧《记忆(Memories)》。

**Rachel:** Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!

**Monica:** No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!

(The phone rings and Rachel answers)

**Rachel:** Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.

**Monica:** Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.

**Rachel:** What?

**Monica:** They've arrested Monica.

[Scene: New York City Department of Correction, Monica is visiting Fake Monica.]

**Fake Monica:** I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?

> turn in v.出卖，告发

**Fake Monica:** Oh. Thanks.

**Monica:** No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing *Memories* on the stage at the *Wintergarden Theater*!

**Fake Monica:** Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.

**Monica:** I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the *Big Apple Circus*?

**Fake Monica:** Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the *Big Apple Circus*?

**Monica:** Well, not... worried, just... wondering怀疑.

**Fake Monica:** There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.

**Monica:** Not necessarily未必，不一定...

**Fake Monica:** Yes necessarily(=absolutely)! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.

**Monica:** Um, I'm not actually Amish.

**Fake Monica:** Really? Then why are you like that?

[Scene: Tap Class, Monica is standing by the door.]

**Teacher:** You by the door. In or out?

**Monica:** In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)

**Teacher:** You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!

**Monica:** Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!

[Scene: The Airport, everyone but Monica is there to see off送行 Marcel.]

**Rachel:** (Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.

**Ross:** Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.

**All: **Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. (They just stand there, then realise what he means and go to the other end of the room)

**Ross:** Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits beside him) Well buddy小兄弟, this is it就这样了. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg抓住腿) Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
