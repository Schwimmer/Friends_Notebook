**Carol:** Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.

**Ross:** Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up搞砸 the first date I had in 9 years.

**Carol:** That could be it.

**Ross:** Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill烤架) You know, this is still pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to粘住 his head. Carol picks it off ,puts it down and licks her finger.)

**Carol:** Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny

**Ross:** No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know.

**Carol:** Oh, I love you too. But...

**Ross:** No but, no but.

**Carol:** You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.

> put over拖延,使被接受,(尤指以欺骗手段)做成功/take the pin out拔出大头针

**Ross:** That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
