*119 猴子被送走 *

*瑞秋得知巴利和她的前伴娘（也是她最好的朋友）敏蒂订婚；她决心重新开始约会男人，于是罗斯想开口约她。 可正当他寻求适当的机会开口时，瑞秋却在帮他照看猴子时把马赛尔弄丢了，两人关系因此出现裂痕。 大家去找猴子，海先生却牛头不对马嘴的说，他丢了一包饼干，他猴子没见过只见过一次Regis Philbin（电视节目《百万富翁》的主持人）。 瑞秋不知道马赛尔属于非法饲养的外来动物，打电话给动物保护协会求助； 动物管理员原来是莫妮卡和瑞秋的高中同学路易萨。 其貌不扬的路易萨对高中时大出风头的瑞秋心怀不满，所以决定不予协助。 在找寻马赛尔的过程中，乔伊和钱德遇到辣妹萨曼莎和啼尔，她们家的散热器坏掉了。 路易萨试图给马赛尔注射麻醉药，菲比飞身扑救，结果身中麻醉枪，半边屁股沉睡不醒。 送到海先生家的香蕉暴露了马赛尔的行踪，大家都到海先生的公寓里， 而海先生却诡辩说猴子是他的，这时路易萨出现了，将猴子关进笼子。 瑞秋恳求路易萨让罗斯继续收养马赛尔，但直到威胁要告发路易萨误伤菲比的事，路易萨才就范。 罗斯和瑞秋终于坐在一起喝酒，就在罗斯开口表白之前，巴利闯了进来，说他还爱着瑞秋。*

[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is talking to a customer.]

**Rachel:** Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? (Guy shakes his head) Okay.

> Earl Grey，English Breakfast，Cinnamon Stick，Camomile,Mint Medley,Blackberry 瑞秋给一个客人端上了茶，她想考验自己的记忆，把一个一个茶名说来：伯爵茶(Earl Grey)，这是英国一个伯爵从中国卸任后带回的红茶和佛手柑油调和在一起后配成的，就以这个伯爵的名字命名English Breakfast是指英国早餐红茶；Cinnamon Stick则是指肉桂茶；Camomile是指甘菊茶；Mint Medley是薄荷混合茶，Blackberry是黑莓茶：Lemon Soother则是将柠檬和药草混合的一种安神茶。尽管瑞秋将这一系列繁复的茶名都记住了，但却记错了顾客。

**Ross:** I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.

**Joey:** She really said that?

**Ross:** Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.

**Joey:** 'Tonight' tonight?

**Ross:** Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...

(Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the open door)

**Rachel:** I know, I know, I'm sorry-

**Ross:** No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.

**Intercom:** Animal Control.

**Rachel:** See? I've even called Animal Control!

**Ross:** You called Animal Control?

**Rachel:** Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?

**Ross:** Marcel is an **illegal **exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.

> An illegal exotic animal外来非法动物

**Rachel:** O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...

**Ross:** That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!

**Rachel:** Hi, thanks for coming.

**Luisa: **(Animal Control) Somebody called about a monkey?

**Rachel:** Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts his arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)

**Ross:** Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.

**Rachel:** Turned out it was a hat.

**Ross:** Cat!

**Rachel:** Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!

(Luisa nods, but then Monica and Phoebe run in)

**Monica:** Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!

**Luisa:** Ah, it's not so much you不关你什么事, you were fat, you had your own problems. (To Rachel) But you? What a **bitch**!

**Ross:** Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.

**Rachel:** Ross, you don't know that不一定.

**Ross:** Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. (Kicks a sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.

**Rachel:** Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you **happy** now?!

**Rachel:** That'd be good.

**Ross:** Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...

**Barry:** Rachel.

**Rachel:** Barry?!

**Barry:** I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.

**Ross:** We have got to start locking that door!

**Closing Credits**

[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Joey, Phoebe, and Chandler are looking through Monica's high school yearbook]

**Monica:** This is me in *The Sound of Music*. See the von Trapp kids?

> Von Trapp 莫尼卡给大家展示高中毕业年鉴中她的照片，并说这是她在出演《音乐之声》时拍的。莫尼卡问菲比有没有看到剧中冯特拉普(Von Trapp)一家的孩子，菲比说没有，莫尼卡说那是因为我在前面。莫尼卡在中学里是以肥胖出名的，所以钱德勒开玩笑说：“天哪，我还以为那是阿尔卑斯山。”《音乐之声》中一家人就是从阿尔卑斯山逃走的。

**Phoebe:** Nope.

**Monica:** That's because I'm in front of them.

**Chandler:** Eh. I thought that was an alp.

> Alp n.高山/Alps n.阿尔卑斯山

**Monica:** Well, high school was not my favourite time.

**Joey:** I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.

**Chandler:** Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.

> boarding school n. 寄宿学校/ Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.每次sex都将会是生活方式的一次重大抉择

**Monica:** Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?

**Phoebe:** Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! (She stands up and starts to dance around) Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
