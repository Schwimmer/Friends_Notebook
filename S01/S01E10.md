110 猴子 
罗斯收养一只叫马赛尔的猴子。 
六人达成协议，在迎接新年的派对上不带伴侣。 
在Central Perk咖啡馆唱歌时，菲比遇到两个争吵不休的男人， 
经过交锋，她和其中一个开始约会，此人名叫大卫，是个科学家。 
两人关系发展顺利，可他接到科研基金，需要赴明斯克工作三年。 
大卫不知所措。 
派对上除了罗斯，人人都忘了约定，带了伴侣参加； 
菲比带大卫，乔伊带着他在百货店遇到的单亲妈妈桑迪； 
瑞秋则带来提前飞回的保路；钱德寂寞难耐邀请了珍妮丝； 
莫妮卡请来fun波比（有酒就fun没酒就boring那个）；罗斯只有马赛尔作伴。 
不过，午夜时分每一对都不欢而散。

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]

**Ross:** Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.

(A monkey jumps on to his shoulder.)

**All:** Oooh!

**Monica:** W-wait. What is that?

**Ross:** 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?

**Monica:** No, no, I don't.

**Rachel:** Oh, he is precious珍贵的! Where did you get him?

**Ross:** My friend Bethelrescued him from some lab.

**Phoebe:** That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?

**Chandler:** Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass那只猴子屁股上长了一个Ross!

**Monica:** Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?

**Ross:** Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...

**Monica:** Why don't you just get a roommate?

**Max:** No. No, that's- that's okay.

**Phoebe:** Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume认为 it's important enough for everyone else to hear!

(They kiss, finally)

[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]

**Ross:** So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?

**Monica:** I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

**Ross:** 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?

**Monica:** I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate(vi.撒尿=pee) on my coffee table.

**Ross:** Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...

**David:** Wow.

**Max:** It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.(Walks off)

**Phoebe:** Are you alright?

**David:** Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

**Phoebe:** Oh, you are so(起强调作用:一定要) going to Minsk. You belong in应归入 Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.

**David:** Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.

**Phoebe:** Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'

> tear apart v. 扯开,把...弄乱,使心碎,把...痛苦地分开

**David:** Uh, ow.

**Phoebe:** Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.

**David:** I'll never forget you.

**Phoebe:** And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it你会下不了决心. (They kiss) I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.

**Joey:** Looks like that no date pact thing worked out奏效.

**Phoebe:** Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.

**Monica:** Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!

(Bobby waves and then bursts into tears突然大哭. Midnight comes and everyone at the party except for the gang cheers and kisses)

**Chandler:** Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)

> whiz v.<非正>高速移动，作飕飕声/whizkid n.神童,杰出青年

**Phoebe:** I dunno. I don't feel like意欲,想要 kissing anyone tonight.

**Rachel:** I can't kiss anyone.

**Monica:** So I'm kissing everyone?

**Ross:** (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much我真想和他好好相处. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
