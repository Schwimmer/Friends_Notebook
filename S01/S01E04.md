104 （克林顿亲信助手）乔治·史特喷那彼拉斯先生 
又到了和前妻卡萝初次嘿咻的纪念日，罗斯心烦意乱，遂跟随钱德和乔伊去看曲棍球比赛，不料遭球击中。 
在医院里，罗斯透露说卡萝是同他有过亲密关系的唯一女性。钱德和乔伊同感不屑。 
瑞秋的昔日闺中密友来访；见旁人春风得意，瑞秋不禁有些怨天尤人。 
三位姑娘办了一场睡衣派对，菲比本想用魔豆的故事安慰瑞秋，却让三人都想到自己的人生没有明确的目标，情绪低迷； 
后来因为送错的披萨，她们发现了在街对面的迷人的史特喷那彼拉斯先生，顿时欢天喜地。

[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there except Joey.]

**Monica:** Alright. Phoebe?

**Phoebe:** Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day某天, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!

> omnipotent adj.全能的，有无限权利的/bigger boobs更大的breast

**Ross:** Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?

**Chandler:** Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.

**Rachel:** See, there's always one guy. (Mocking) "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes." (Joey enters.)

**All:** Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.

**Monica:** Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?

**Joey:** Probably kill myself!

> impotent adj.a.无力的，软弱无能的b.阳痿的/几个老友一起聊天，Phoebe说如果她能做一天无所不能的上帝，她就会希望世界和平、没有饥饿、不会滥伐森林以及有大的boobs。Phoebe心地很善良，从上一集她把意外之财送给无家可归的流浪人就可窥见一斑，所以她的愿望都是关于人类发展生存的，当然咯，她也没忘说需要大的boobs，呵呵，想必是小小的恶作剧，挖苦一下Monica吧。Boob常见的意思是蠢材、笨蛋，不过在俚语中也有胸脯、乳房的意思。这之后更精彩的是Joey，他也没听清楚别人到底讨论什么，就来了一句，说如果是他的话，不如死掉算了，大家莫名其妙，还好Ross最了解他。原来，Joey听成如果他阳痿（impotent）了……，呵呵，搞笑吧,看来这部电视剧中很多有关Sex的笑话哦。

**Monica:** ..Excuse me?

**Joey:** Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!

**Ross:** Joey, uh- **OM**nipotent.

**Joey:** You *are*? Ross, I'm sorry..

**Opening Credits**

[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Monica are watching Phoebe sleep.]

**Monica:** How does she do that?

**Ross:** I cannot sleep in a public place.

**Monica:** Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.

**Phoebe:** (waking and startling them) Oh! What what what! ...Hi.

> startle v.震惊,使大吃一惊

**Ross:** It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.

> nod off v.打盹，打瞌睡

**Monica:** What's going on with you?

**Phoebe:** I got no sleep last night!

**Ross:** Why?

**Phoebe:** My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!

> insecure adj.不可靠的, 不安全的/be insecure in bed在床上翻来覆去/reassure vt.使...安心, 再保证, 使...恢复信心, 打消...的疑虑/ Pheebs这样说就是为了表达“her grandmother and her bf are having sex ”，其实也是编剧比较搞笑的一个地方，意思是“我奶奶和她的新男朋友都是那种在床上十分insecure没有安全感（也就是没自信）的人，加上他们都是聋子，所以他们需要不断的去求证对方对此（sex）是否享受，你根本无法想象他们有多吵……”BTW，老美十分在乎他们have sex之后对方的感觉，在《friends》中多处会提到，这里就不多说啦，呵呵。

**Monica:** Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.

**Phoebe:** Thanks.

(Chandler and Joey enter. Joey is counting his steps.)

**Joey:** ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.

**Chandler:** You got waaaay too much free time你真的很有空诶.

> way too就是太怎么怎么样。WAY表示程度深。eg:u r way too young to see that

**Joey:** (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.

> check it out瞧一瞧/hockey n.曲棍球,<美>冰球/Ranger n.护林者队/Penguin n.企鹅队

**Chandler:** Happy birthday, pal!

> pal n.<口>好朋友，伙伴，同志

**Joey:** We love you, man. (Kisses Ross)

**Ross:** Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.

**Joey:** So?

**Ross:** So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?

**Chandler:** Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty." 悲观的人

> Mr．“The glass is half empty”有这样的一种比喻“如果有一个只装了一半水的水杯，乐观者认为‘水杯有一半是满得’悲观者则认为‘有一半是空的’”，这就是“pessimist”和“The glass is half empty.”关系的由来。 CHAN说的“Mr. "The glass is half empty."”确实等于pessimist（悲观主义者）的意思，当ROSS说“我猜你们是因为多出来一张票而不知道叫谁一起去，所以才叫我的”，现在爱搞笑的CHAN又开始发挥他的幽默去企图否认ROSS的看法，于是狡辩到：“哈哈，你以为我们像这么悲观的人吗？（潜台词是：你以为我们真的是惨到找不到其他的人一起去才找你吗？）”呵呵，其实CHAN的幽默对中国人来说，有时候理解起来会有点费劲～～意会吧！

**Ross:** Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?

**Monica:** Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.

**Ross:** Ohhh.

**Joey:** What's wrong with the twentieth?

**Chandler:** Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?

**Ross:** Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

> consummate v.a.使完善，使达到极点 b.（初次同房而）完（婚）/pass on v.去世=pass away，传递 to 不去eg:pass on my best wish to sb,请代为转达我最美好的祝愿。

**Joey:** The hell with 去他的hockey, let's all do that!

**Chandler:** (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh?

> punch v.用拳猛击

**Ross:** What are you doing?

**Chandler:** (stops) I have no idea.

**Joey:** C'mon, Ross!

**Ross:** Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?

> big thumb finger,是一个在球场里买的一个很大的泡沫作的手掌,可以套在手臂上挥舞,104的球场镜头里应该看的到.

**Chandler:** You got it.

(Rachel runs up cluching an envelope.)

**Rachel:** Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window框框, there's my name! Hi, me!

> FICA abbr.Federal Insurance Contributions Act (美国)联邦社会保险捐款法/ FICA:瑞秋拿到了第一张工资单，意外地发现金额很少，而且一个FICA的家伙拿走了她的很多钱。其实，这是从来没有工作过的瑞秋不了解情况，FICA并非是哪个人，而是根据联邦保险法案(Federal Insurance Contribution Act)规定员工必须交纳的社会保障金和医疗保险金，它可以占到收入的百分之七左右，对低收入者影响较大。/ The FICA tax, also known as the Social Security tax, is paid equally by the employer and employee. This tax is composed of two elements: 1. OASDI -- The old age, survivor and disability portion of the tax is paid on wages up to the maximum covered wage base for the year. 2. HI -- The hospital insurance or Medicare portion of the tax is paid on all wages, without limit.

**Leslie:** (looking around) Rachel?

**Rachel:** Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne all scream and hug each other.)

**Monica:** (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this on *Wild** Kingdom*.

> Wild Kingdom 瑞秋的几个旧时姐妹来找她，她们都大声尖叫，莫尼卡对一边的菲比嘲讽地说：我在《野生王国(Wild Kingdom)》里也没有看到鸟类这样过。《野生王国》是和《国家地理》齐名的动物保护节目。

**Rachel:** What are you guys doing here?

**Kiki:** Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!

**Joanne:** Look at you in the apron围裙. You look like you're in a play在演戏一样.

**Rachel:** (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!

**Leslie:** I know. I know! I'm a duplex.

**Rachel:** (to Joanne) So what's going on with you?

**Joanne:** Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm公司? (She points to herself and they all scream again.)

**Chandler:** (to Joey) Could've been a peach.

**Ross:** Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine.

**Joey:** Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! (They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.

[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel, Lesile, Kiki, and Joanne are talking.]

**Rachel:** So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt八卦!

**Monica:** Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? (She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the contents of the blender into some glasses.)

**Rachel:** What's that?

**Monica:** Weeeell, it's rum, and-

**Rachel:** Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to drink.)

**Monica:** We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got *Twister*... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.)

> slumber n.睡眠v.睡眠/trashy adj.无价值的, 没有用的, 垃圾似的/trashy magazine八卦报纸/dough n.生面团

**Monica:** (on phone) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to关于(Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.

**Rachel:** But I haven't used my card in weeks!

**Monica:** That **is **the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.

**Rachel:** They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting pregnant, or getting promoted, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?

**Monica:** (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?

**Rachel:** Alright, c'mon! (Miserably悲惨地)t's play *Twister*!

[Scene: *Madison** SquareGarden*, the guys are trying to find their seats.]

**Ross:** (squeezing压，挤st people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.

**Chandler:** What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

> Pittsburgh n.匹兹堡（美国宾西法尼亚州西南部城市, 是美国的钢铁工业中心）

**Ross:** No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there **was** ice there that night... It was the first frost霜..

**Joey:** C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, they're all hanging out in the living room.]

**Monica:** You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!

**Rachel:** Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?

**Phoebe:** You are just like Jack.

**Rachel:** ...Jack from downstairs?

**Phoebe:** No, Jack and the Beanstalk豆茎

> Jack and the Beanstalk:瑞秋后悔自己离家出走，菲比则用《杰克和魔豆(Jack and the Beanstalk)》的故事劝慰她。这是著名的西方童话：杰克用一头牛换了三颗魔豆，妈妈生气地将魔豆扔出窗外，第二天魔豆长得高入云霄，杰克爬上魔豆，从巨人那里偷走了金币和会下金蛋的母鸡。菲比的用意是告诉瑞秋，虽然你放弃了牛，但你得到了自立生活的魔豆。/《Jack and Magicbeans》的故事啦，我想应该是那个“种了一颗越长越高的豆苗，然后JACK就顺着豆苗爬到天上去了…………”的故事吧，anyway，古怪的Phoe其实用了个不是很贴切的故事去比喻Rach现在的情况（不过Phoe就是这样子的啦～），简单来说，就是Rach用Jack放弃了一头牛来比喻她自己放弃了Barry这个正牙牙医（因为在美国，牙医和律师都是收入很高且受人尊重的职业），但她自己又不爱Barry，所以Phoe又傻乎乎的冒出一句“（但不同的是），Jack爱他的牛呀！”我想编剧这样安排是想有一点表现Phoe性格的效果啦，所以，还是那句…………意会啦！

**Monica:** Ah, the other Jack.

**Phoebe:** Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in **the** Village..

> Village:Phe在罗列jack和rach的相同之处，jack住在一个真正的村子里，而纽约的住宅区大多也都叫Village，（Greenwich Village，East Village，West Village），这在Phe眼中也是相同点

**Rachel:** Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-

**Phoebe:** Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

**Rachel:** But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...

**Phoebe:** Floopy不顺心的？

> Floopy:It doesnt mean anything. Its just a word *they* chose to describe that messed up feeling where nothing is solid and nothing is sure (instead it's changeable) floopy makes people think of rubber or a wet fish flopping around. 事事没有把握，不确定的感觉。floop around 是转悠的意思吧，不是说它就是明确的词组，就是这种感觉.it's all gonna come together。come together意思是步上轨道，一切就绪的意思。很常用的词

**Rachel:** Yeah.

**Monica:** So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.

**Phoebe:** Oh, like that's a word真能掰

**Rachel:** Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together(集合to走上正轨)？

**Monica:** ...Pheebs?

**Phoebe:** Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.

**Rachel:** Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?

> what if如果……怎么办？

[Scene: *Madison** SquareGarden*, the guys are watching the game.]

**Ross:** Get him宰了他! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!

**Chandler:** (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.

**Ross:** Pass it! Pass it!

**Chandler:** He's open!

**All:** Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

(The player shoots and the puck flies off the rink and hits Ross in the face. Chandler looks concerned until he notices...)

> puck n.恶作剧的小妖精to冰球/rink n.冰场

**Chandler:** Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!

(Chandler and Joey hold the puck and wave at the TV thing.)

**Commercial Break**

[Scene: An Emergency Room, Chandler and Joey are leading Ross in.]

**Chandler:** (to the receptionist)'Scuse me.

> receptionist n.招待员, 传达员

**Receptionist:** (holds up her hand—she is on the phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar(n.条, 棒). Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

**Chandler:** Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)

> predicament n.困境/ predicament room个人感觉在第一季导演老让CHAN说写特别文邹邹的话来搞笑所以很多问题都是第一季的，这里就是说医院里有各种病房，你不理我们我们就去尴尬病房？

**Receptionist:** (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.)

> fill out v.填写，长大，使变大/toss v.投，掷

> jump to立即，马上/jump to his feet他马上站起来/dented adj.凹的

**Receptionist:** Well, you'll have to wait your turn.

**Joey:** Well, how long do you think it'll be?

**Receptionist:** (sarcastic) Any minute now快了.

**Ross:** Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys back off后退) Heyy...

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the slumber party continues.]

**Rachel:** I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.

> bring down v.打倒, 击落, 打死, 降低/bring sb down使你们不开心

Monica:

 No, you were right. I don't have a plan. (There's a knock on the door.)

**Pizza Guy:** (yelling from outside) Pizza guy!

**Rachel:** Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the door应门.)

**Monica:** Phoebe?

**Phoebe:** What?

**Monica:** Do you have a plan?

**Phoebe:** I don't even have a 'pl'.

> pl:此处的笑点很有意思，将plan一拆二，变为 pl 意思就是说：计划？八字还没一撇呐！

**Pizza Guy:** Hi, one, uh, mushroom蘑菇, green pepper青椒 and onion洋葱?

**Rachel:** (miserably) No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free脱脂的 crust脆皮 with extra cheese.

> fat free就是无脂肪的,就像无糖叫sugar-free,这里的free不是指免费,是指"无"(电影back to the future里还拿这个当笑料,主人公从80年代到了50年代到小店要一瓶无糖百事--pepsi free,店员就不懂说"u need to pay for it"),extra cheese就是double cheese,老美喜欢吃奶酪,常规的pizza上的一层奶酪觉得不够爽,所以定的时候要求再加一层,当然这个要加钱的.

**Pizza Guy:** Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!

**Monica:** (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'

Pizza Guy:

 Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead笨蛋, bonehead!

**Monica:** Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?

> Mediterranean n.adj.地中海

**Pizza Guy:** Yeah, that sounds about right听起来应该是他.

**Monica:** Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?

> stunning adj.足以使人晕倒的, 极好的

**Phoebe:** And-and a power tie?

> power adj.指"强有力的",她门可能特喜欢那个叫Stephanopoulos 的政客,所以他的什么东西都是power的.

**Pizza Guy:** No, pretty much just a towel.

> pretty much 几乎，非常接近/towel n.毛巾，浴巾

**Monica:** (staggered摇摇摆摆的) Oh God.

**Pizza Guy:** So you guys want me to take this back?

**Monica:** Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the window.)

> nuts adj.热衷的, 发狂的int.呸, 胡说/binoculars n.双筒望远镜/monocular adj.单眼的，单目镜的，单筒的

**Rachel:** Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?

> George Stephanopoulos:Friends 第一季在美国播出时，是一九九四年，当时是克林顿当总统，而George Stephanopoulos就是那个时期克林顿政策顾问的名字。George斯特凡诺普洛斯是克林顿总统时期白宫负责政策和政治运作的总统高级顾问，后离职去哥伦比亚大学教书，他是希腊移民，长相俊俏，算是常上新闻的热门人物。所以在这段之前的对话，Monica还一直追问送比萨的小弟，那人是否长得像地中海地区的人，当她确定那人的长相之后，就感到非常地兴奋。/至于Phoebe为何会回答是《芝麻街》里“大鸟”Big Bird的朋友呢？这其实是一个非常有趣的笑点。因为这里Rachel是一时口误，竟然把政治人物George Stephanopoulos念成Georege Snuffalopagus。而在美国家喻户晓的儿童节目《芝麻街》内，大鸟一直幻想出来的好朋友，就叫做Snuffalopagus，但它不是人，而是一只可爱的大象。

**Phoebe:** Big Bird's friend.

**Monica:** I see pizza!

**Phoebe:** Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She runs up跑过去 and takes the binoculars.)

**Rachel:** Hello? Who are we spying on侦察，暗中监视?

**Monica:** White House adviser顾问? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?

> campaign n.（政治性）竞选活动/butt n.臀部

**Rachel:** Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!

**Phoebe:** Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.

**Monica:** Please tell me it's his mother.

**Phoebe:** Definitely not his mother.

**Monica:** Oh, no...

**Phoebe:** Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for you, bitch臭女人! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.)

[Scene: The Emergency Room, Joey is miming hockey pucks kitting foreheads. Chandler realises it's getting tense紧张的 and goes to the receptionist again.]

**Chandler:** Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns, and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-!

> gladd panel 挡板/slide the glad panel滑动挡板/mad adj.生气的，激动的，疯狂的/ that gug with the toe thing脚趾受伤的人;chandler的这个笑话,如果放在中国就是"他是不是开了后门",只是他指的这个后门不是通关系或者送钱,而是直接贡献身体.当然因为这个脚趾受伤的是个男人(guy),所以就显的好笑,因为一般只有女人贡献身体才有用.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the girls are all out on the balcony.]

**Monica:** Light still out?

> light is still out 我们说关灯,他们是说关“光”的.

**Rachel:** Yeah.

**Monica:** Oh. Maybe they're- napping.

> nap=nod off v.小睡，打盹

**Rachel:** Oh please, they're having sex.

**Monica and Phoebe:** Shut up!

**Rachel:** So, whaddya think George is like?

**Monica:** I think he's shy.

**Phoebe:** Yeah?

**Monica:** Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.

> draw out v.抽出, 拉长, 使说出实情, 拟订, 跑到别人前面并拉开距离 to勾引/ preppy(=preppien)n.(大学)预科生adj.未熟的/指那个r政客，说他是"闷骚"型的,要先把他挑逗起来,一旦挑逗起来,他就变得像动物一样狂野了。preppy animal。PREPPY就是大学新生的意思，是SLANG，这里MON就是形容GEORGE的. preppy就是所谓的雅皮，总是衣冠楚楚的，preppy animal 就该是表面文雅，热情上来了就成野兽了。

[Scene: The Emergency Room, Ross is still going on about his first night with Carol.]

> go on about v.唠唠叨叨地谈...

**Ross:** I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow(vi.发光，发热).

**Chandler:** Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?

> painkiller n.止痛药

**Joey:** He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.

**Ross:** Look, it's just a little more complicated...

**Chandler:** Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?

**Ross:** Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma在昏迷中 that didn't quite hear you...

**Chandler:** Then what?

**Ross:** My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles the last part)

> mumble n.喃喃而语, 咕哝, 闭嘴细嚼v.喃喃而语, 咕哝

**Joey:** What?

**Ross:** It was my **first time**.

**Joey:** With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh.

**Chandler:** So in your whole life, you've only been with one—(He gets a look too)—oh.

**Joey:** Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the girls are still out on the balcony.]

**Monica:** Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?

> pate n.肉酱，鱼酱/vegetarian pate蔬菜肉酱/phoebe是素食者,monica作弄她,说是给她作了个全素的pie,其实里面有鹅肉。Phoebe是素食主义者，Monica曾经谎称给她做了个“蔬菜pate”,其实里面掺了鹅肉。这对Phoebe来说是个很大的打击。就好像有人请穆斯林一起吃肉，而且是牛肉，结果他们实际上给回民吃的是猪肉，这对他们来说是种亵渎

**Phoebe:** Uh-huh.

**Monica:** Well, unless goose鹅肉 is a vegetable...ha haaaah!

**Phoebe:** Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

**Monica:** What?! You slept with Jason?

**Phoebe:** You'd already broken up.

**Rachel:** How long?

**Phoebe:** A couple hours.

**Monica:** Oh, that's nice!

**Rachel:** Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker锁柜 was really from me.

> valentine:本身就是情人节礼物；情人节是 Valentine's Day

**Monica:** Excuse me?!

**Rachel:** Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? (To Phoebe) She was a **big girl**她太天真了.

**Monica:** Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!

**Rachel:** I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica and Rachel start to squabble争论)

**Phoebe:** There he is! There he is!

**Monica:** Where?

**Phoebe:** Right- where we've been looking all night!

**Rachel:** He is so cute!

**Monica:** Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!

**All:** Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the—(pause)—wowww.

[Scene: The Emergency Room, Ross is absent.]

**Joey:** Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?

**Chandler:** I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...

**Joey:** Really?

**Chandler:** No, you kidding? The guy's a freak怪胎..I judge him (Ross enters off camera)

> freak n.怪诞的思想、行动或事件, 畸形人, 畸形的动物或植物, 反复无常adj.奇异的, 反常的

**Both:** Hey, buddy.

**Ross:** Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose. He tosses some forms onto reception desk.)

**Receptionist:** (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive.

**Chandler:** Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.

**Ross:** Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?

**Joey:** Oh, ah- the kid has it.

**Ross:** The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.

**Kid:** I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers. (Ross looks at Chandler for help.)

> weep n.v.哭, 哭泣, 滴下/小时候大家都玩过的赖皮童谣，东西掉了，谁拣到的就是谁的。

**Chandler:** You gotta do it, man.

**Ross:** (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.

> 用重创换来的puck居然被小孩拿去了，还阵阵有词的说谁拣到就归谁，Chandler怂恿他也来一段儿童谣，他鼓足勇气说了一半，终究还是捺不下面子。“I’m rubber,you’re glue，whatever (you say bounces off me and stick to you)”在Friends中出现了好几次，这里显然也是小孩子们拌嘴皮子时候用的。意思是我是橡皮你是胶水，你说的所有坏话都会反弹回去粘在你身上，引申过来也就是：你说我坏话实际就是骂你自己。

**Kid:** No.

**Ross:** 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!

**Kid:** No! No! (They start to fight over it.)

**Receptionist:** Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!

> holding n.所有物/rough holding粗暴的行为/ER:emergency room

**Ross:** (tries to snatch攫取 it from the kid) GIVE ME MY PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist)

> file out v.鱼贯而出 锉出 /grasp n.紧握

**Ross:** ...Now **that** was fun.

**Closing Credits**

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey and the girls are playing twister.]

(There's a knock on the door, Chandler opens it, and silently hands back the cushion.)

**Chandler:** Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves)

**Ross:** Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. (Phoebe has to bend over.)Good. (Joey stares at her butt appreciatively)

> bend over俯身,屈从

(The phone rings and Chandler answers it.)

**Chandler:** Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the *Visa *card people.

**Rachel:** Oh, okay. Will you take my place?

**Chandler:** Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel.

**Rachel:** Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler takes her place on the mat垫子，席子.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.

**Ross:** Green. To the green.

**Rachel:** (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens) Never-never mind.

**Chandler:** To the left, to the left- aww! (They all collapse)

**Rachel:** (on phone) Ohhh... I'm fine.
