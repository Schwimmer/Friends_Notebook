**Ross:** Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.

(The lights go up on the stage, Joey, as Freud, is talking to a female patient.)

**Joey:** Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number)

> 大家讽刺Monica的洁癖 Phoebe发出一串“Ree……”的怪叫声，是在模仿电影《惊魂记》Psycho中，凶手在浴室中杀人的恐怖背景音乐，这声音一出现，大家就会联想到片子中疯子的行径。所以Phoebe模仿这叫声，就是指Monica的行为不正常，把他吓得时时心神不宁。

**Monica:** That is so unfair!
