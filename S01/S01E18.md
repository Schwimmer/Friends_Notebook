*118 玩扑克*

*瑞秋腻烦了当女侍应，送出许多简历应聘；*

*她在第五大道上（首屈一指的）Saks Fifth Avenue百货公司得到面试机会。*

*罗斯为瑞秋倾倒。*

*男人们玩扑克牌，三个女人也想加入，男人们犹豫着答应了。*

*女人们初学乍练输掉第一局，想再玩一次。争强好胜的莫妮卡一发不可收拾…*

*她曾在画图猜单词的游戏中摔碎一只盘子，不过她坚称那只是个小事故。*

*莫妮卡找来救兵，五岁即开始玩牌的艾瑞丝舅妈；艾瑞丝舅妈传授了许多玩扑克的金科玉律，但几个女人仍然败北；*

*第三局，女人们败势已显；雪上加霜的是，瑞秋接到面试失败的消息，因此玩命的玩牌；她将罗斯逼到很高的赌注……而罗斯故意让她赢了，只因为他想看到她开心。*

**Chandler:** Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.

> The Flintstones石头族乐园：一部美国风味很浓的喜闹剧，改编自流行一时的电视卡通影集。本片的最大噱头是很多现代化的用具放在上古时代，因时空错置而产生笑料，整体而言较投合小孩子的趣味。本片由大导演史蒂文斯皮尔伯格旗下的安布林公司拍摄，斯皮尔伯格本人更亲自担任影片的制片。本片当年(1994)被誉为是一部具有视觉创造性的影片，采用电脑特技将一个快乐神奇的摩登石头族的乐园呈现在大家的面前。

> The Flintstones could've really happened 钱德勒问罗斯为什么不约会林达，罗斯说不知道。钱德勒想起林达认为“《摩登石头族(The Flintstones)》电影中的情节真的可能在现实中发生”，这是一本描写两个石器时代家庭和现代科技交织的名片。身为古生物学家，罗斯当然认为这种时空错乱是荒谬的，钱德勒认为是这一点让罗斯不想约会林达。

**Ross:** The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.

**Phoebe:** Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.

> 这句话来源于一句古语：It's like the pot calling the kettle black罐子笑壶黑。即：五十步笑百步因为很多铁制炊具为黑色。意思是，你在嘲讽别人时，其实自己也一样，就好像说，"It takes one to know one"， 彼此彼此。 这里rach先说ross让人难以忍受，mon附议说，他有时的确让人发疯；pheebs就讽刺她说，乌鸦笑猪黑，你还不是一样。

**Monica:** Please! I am not as bad as Ross.

**Rachel:** Oh, I beg to differ. The *Pictionary* incident?

> beg to differ恕不同意/ Pictionary 老友们玩的一种游戏，Pictionary是Picture和Dictionary的合成词，意思就是一个游戏者画出某个东西，另外的游戏者猜是代表哪个词。

**Rachel:** No.

**Monica:** I don't think so.

**Rachel:** Why?

**Aunt Iris:** Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.

**Monica:** What?

**Monica:** Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?

**Rachel:** No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.

**Ross:** Alright.

[Scene: Ross's Apartment, continued from earlier.]

**Ross:** So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones大便.

**Joey:** But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.

> Cross-Eyed Mary斜眼玛丽。这是来自于IRON MAIDEN的一首歌。女孩们刚学的扑克招数里有个eye contact trick，往左斜眼代表“缺梅花”之类的，男孩们就把这个trick戏称做Cross-Eyed Mary

**Phoebe:** Alright, here's my $7.50. (Hands them the money) But I think you should know that this money is cursed.

> cursed adj.被诅咒的, 邪恶的

**Joey:** What?

**Phoebe:** Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.

**Chandler:** That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.

> break up with a movie看完一场电影

**Ross:** Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...

**Rachel:** Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)

> Penis=peepee

**Rachel:** Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.

**Monica:** OK, we done with the chit-chat闲聊? Are we ready to play some serious poker?

**Phoebe:** (holding a card and waving it in front of her face) Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. (they look at her) Right, OK, serious poker.

(Ross gets up from the table.)

**Monica:** Excuse me, where are you going?

**Ross:** Uh... to the bathroom.

**Monica:** Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?

**Ross:** I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)

**Joey:** Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. (gets up)

**Rachel:** Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.

**Joey:** That's fine. I'll just have a *Tic-Tac* to hold me over.

> Tic-Tac：n.一种薄荷糖/hold sb over提神

**Monica:** Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)

> Cincinnati：这是一种家庭扑克牌（Home game）的玩法，又称之为Utah, Lamebrains, or California，widow game 和southern cross也与此相似。Cincinnati 的具体玩法是每个人都发5张牌，牌底朝下(face down)，剩下的牌则放在桌子中央。先下一轮注（a round of betting）,然后由牌童（houseman）或发牌人（dealer）揭开桌子中央底牌底（turn up the central card），每揭开一张又下一轮注, 在最后一张牌揭晓时（showdown），每个玩家选用他手上最好的5张牌比大小。

> No blinds, everybody ante：未见牌不得下注。ante和blinds都是下注的方式。ante是出牌（deal）前所下的注，而且不算作下回赌注中的一部分；blinds则恰恰相反，在不看自己的下一张牌时就下注，而且会成为下次赌注的一部分。

**Phoebe:** (looks at her cards) Yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.

(Ross comes back from bathroom.)

**Ross:** Alright. (to Rachel): Your money's mine, Green菜鸟.

**Rachel:** Your fly(n.校门，拉链) is open, Geller. (he checks it, and zips up)

(Time lapse.)

**Phoebe:** You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?

**Chandler:** Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!巧合中有个巧字。

**Joey:** Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?

**Phoebe:** Yeah. Um... I'm out. (throws in cards)

> 跟不跟是“in or out”

**Rachel:** I'm in.

**Monica:** Me too.

**Joey:** Me too. Alright, whattaya got.

**Ross:** Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. (lays down cards)

> hop v.单脚跳/shower n.浴室/

> flush：是5张牌都是同花不连成一句话.一手牌（hand）比大小时，four of kind>full house>flush>straight。Four of kind是4张一样的，大概相当于4个炸弹。Full House是指5张牌中有3张一样的（3个k）和2张一样的（2个3）， straight flush是同花顺，Straight是5张牌连成一句话（56789），但不同花色。

**Rachel:** Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! (lays down cards) I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? (collects chips) I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. (holds up a chip) I think that one was Ross's, and I think—oh—that one was Ross's. Yes! (Starts singing): *Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it*...

> Hop back in bucko回来吧美元。

> 下注时的那个红，兰色的小片片叫chip。

(Ross stands up.)

**Rachel:** And your fly's still open...

(Ross looks down.)

**Rachel:** Ha, I made you look....

(Time lapse.)

**Rachel:** I couldn't be inner. Monica?

**Phoebe:** Monica, in or out?

**Monica:** (slams down cards) I hate this game!

(Joey slides a plate away from Monica towards Chandler, who hides it under the table.)

**Phoebe:** OK Joey, your bet.

> 下注一般是bet

**Joey:** Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) Oh, I'm out.

> 不玩了就说“I fold.”/hooker n.渔船,<俚>二流妓女/stomach n.肚子，胃/sore n.痛处，伤处

**Phoebe:** Ross?

**Ross:** Oh, I am very in.

**Phoebe:** Chandler?

**Chandler:** Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)

**Phoebe:** Me too. Rachel.

**Rachel:** Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. (throws chips in pot) What do you say... want to waste another buck?

> raise:表示提高赌注，在一个limit game中（赌注有上限）, 通常是raise the bet to the limit. Call是与对方的注持平（match a bet）eg:I will see you，I’ll see a bet:我跟着你下注/in pot一叠叠地

**Ross:** No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?

**Rachel:** I'm not telling. (collects chips)

**Ross:** Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up)

**Ross:** Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...

**Rachel:** (answering phone) Hel-lo, Rachel Green.

**Ross:** (mimicking Rachel) Mee mee, mee-mee mee.

**Rachel:** (on phone) Excuse me. (covers up phone; to Ross) It's about the **job**.

(Rachel walks into kitchen to talk on the phone.)

**Rachel:** Barbara! Hi, how are you? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, plea—Hello? Hello? (hangs up phone, very depressed)

> Open up v.(职位)空缺

(Rachel goes back and sits down. The rest don't know what to say.)

**Monica:** Sorry, Rach.

**Phoebe:** Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.

**Rachel:** Yeah...(sigh)....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.

**Rachel:** (to Ross): Loser?

(Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe back their chairs away from the table.)

> back away v.退后

**Ross:** No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)

**Rachel:** What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?

> be full of it 对此满足

(Ross thinks it over, finally sits down and picks up his cards.)

**Ross:** I'm in. (throws in chips)

**Rachel:** How many you want?

**Ross:** One. (Rachel gives him the card.)

**Rachel:** Dealer takes two庄家两张. (she deals herself two cards) What do you bet?

**Ross:** I bet two dollars. (throws it in)

**Rachel:** OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. (throws it in)

**Ross:** I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)

(The other four look amazed at the large pot筹码.)

**Rachel:** See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.

(Monica gets up, looks in Rachel's purse.)

**Monica:** Rachel, there's nothing in it.

**Rachel:** OK, then get me your purse.

(Monica gets Rachel her purse.)

**Monica:** OK, here you go. Good luck.

**Rachel:** (to Monica): Thank you. (to Ross): I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.

**Phoebe:** ...teen! (throws in a ten-dollar bill)

(Ross looks in his wallet, pulls out two dollars.)

**Ross:** (to Joey): Joey, I'm a little shy我钱有点不够.

**Joey:** That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?

(Ross looks at Joey, dumbfounded at his stupidity.)

> dumbfound (v.使人哑然失声, 使发楞) at his stupidity(n.愚蠢)

**Chandler:** (to Ross): What do you need, what do you need?

**Ross:** Fifteen.

**Chandler:** Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)

**Joey:** Here, I got five, I got five. (Ross takes the money)

**Ross:** Thank you.

**Chandler:** Good luck.

**Ross:** (to Rachel): OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?

(Long pause as they both look at each other.)

**Rachel:** (lays down cards) Full house.

> Full house葫芦

(Ross stares at her. Thinks about it. Puts cards on table, face down.)

**Ross:** You got me你赢我了.

(Monica and Phoebe get up and start celebrating in the kitchen, pouring wine and singing. Rachel, shocked, goes to join them.)

**Joey:** (to Ross): Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat她的牌太好了.

**Chandler:** (to Ross): I thought we had them!

**Ross:** Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)

(Chandler and Joey look at her, and then look back at him. They dive for Ross's hand to see what he had, and he tries to stop them from looking.)

> dive for v.向...扑去,潜水寻找

**Closing Credits**

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, all six are playing *Pictionary* at Monica's apartment. Monica is drawing a picture, and the three guys are guessing. She draws what looks like an airplane.]

**Chandler:** *Airplane*! *Airport*! *Airport '75*! *Airport '77*! *Airport '79*!

(Timer goes off.)

**Rachel:** Oh, time's up.

**Monica:** (pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... **BIRDIE**.

> birdie n.小鸟

**Joey:** Oh!

**Phoebe:** **That's** a bird?

(Monica glares at Phoebe.)

**Phoebe:** That's a **bird**!

(Monica sits, Rachel gets up.)

**Rachel:** OK, OK, it's my turn. (reads the answer)

**Chandler:** Go.

(Rachel starts drawing what looks like a bean.)

**Ross:** Uh.... bean! Bean!

(Rachel begins tapping the picture of the bean frantically.)

**Joey:** (triumphantly) *The Unbearable Likeness of Being*!

> The Unbearable Likeness of Being：生命中不能承受之轻。大家在Monica家聚会，玩一个叫Pictionary的游戏，这个游戏的玩法就是有人画图，让大家猜成语或字。Joey的回答其实是一个相当好笑的谐音，实际答案《生命中不能承受之轻》的正确原文应该是The Unbearable Lightness of Being. 这是知名捷克作家米兰.昆德拉（Milan Kundera）的著名小说，曾改编成电影《布拉格的春天》。但此处Rachel画了一颗“豆子” bean, bean和being音近，Joey又觉得Rachel的豆子画的“受不了的相像”Unbearable Likeness，所以他就组成了这句The Unbearable Likeness of Bean，表面意义是“像得不得了的豆子”，但谐音就是The Unbearable Lightness of Being，所以他答对了。

**Rachel:** Yes!

**Monica:** **That**, you get? **That**, you get?

(Monica picks up a glass to take a drink, everyone ducks as though she was about to throw it.)
